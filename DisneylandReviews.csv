670772142,4,2019-4,Australia,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"670682799,4,2019-5,Philippines,""Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman .. Changed by previous Buzz lightyear! More or less d same, but I'm expecting to have something most!!However, my boys like it!!Space Mountain .. Turns into Star Wars!! This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!! Seems more local like Ocean Park or even worst!!They got no SMILING face, but just wanna u to enter n attraction n leave!!Hello this is supposed to be Happiest Place on Earth brand!! But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670623270,4,2019-4,United Arab Emirates,""Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670607911,4,2019-4,Australia,""HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670607296,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,""the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670591897,3,2019-4,Singapore,""Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property."",Disneyland_HongKong"
670585330,5,2019-4,India,Great place! Your day will go by and you won't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.,Disneyland_HongKong
"670574142,3,2019-3,Malaysia,""Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670571027,2,2019-4,Australia,""Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670570869,5,2019-3,India,""I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush."",Disneyland_HongKong"
670443403,5,2019-4,United States,Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     ,Disneyland_HongKong
"670435886,5,2019-4,Canada,""We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670376905,4,2019-4,Australia,""We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season."",Disneyland_HongKong"
670324965,5,2019-4,Philippines,It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,Disneyland_HongKong
"670274554,5,2018-9,Australia,""This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670205135,3,2019-1,United Kingdom,""We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670199487,4,2019-4,Myanmar (Burma),""Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
670129921,3,2019-4,United Kingdom,Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesn't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670099231,4,2019-4,Australia,It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience,Disneyland_HongKong
670033848,5,2018-11,Hong Kong,There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!,Disneyland_HongKong
"670030877,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,""We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"670022335,3,2019-4,United States,""First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience)."",Disneyland_HongKong"
670007081,3,2019-4,United States,Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"669996858,3,2019-4,Singapore,""I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"669783708,5,2019-4,Australia,""GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait."",Disneyland_HongKong"
669548161,3,2019-4,Hong Kong,Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,Disneyland_HongKong
"669528186,3,2019-4,Australia,""This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks."",Disneyland_HongKong"
669403596,5,2018-12,Philippines,We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!,Disneyland_HongKong
669353396,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"669186152,3,2019-4,Australia,""I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"669093045,5,2019-4,Australia,""Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"669050447,4,2019-4,Australia,""A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"668819140,5,2019-4,Australia,""I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"668798543,5,2019-4,China,""This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"668777351,4,2018-12,Australia,""We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK don't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesn't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we didn't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages."",Disneyland_HongKong"
668611003,4,2019-4,Australia,Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.,Disneyland_HongKong
"668242919,4,2019-4,Australia,""Hong Kong is easy to get to via the MTR from Kowloon, great signage and fast. Our day started well but just after arriving it started to rain quite heavily and didn't stop until mid afternoon. Characters were out in the main street but only saw two during the day, probably due to the rain. Even though the crowds on entry were big once inside it didn't seem crowded at all, Toy Story Land was a ghost town with no one going on the rides in the rain. We enjoy the rides that were open and all in all had a good day. Had heard great things about Mystic Manor but found it just okay, loved Hyperspace Mountain, Ant Man and Ironman. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars were my favorite of the day! Though shopping wasn't as good as Disneyland in the USA which was disappointing, catering mainly to children. Happy to have visited but don't think I'd go to Hong Kong again."",Disneyland_HongKong"
668209978,5,2018-9,Australia,You have to visit to understand the memorable experience. It is a place that brings out the child in everyone. You have to stay for the fireworks. Food is expensive so take snacks along.,Disneyland_HongKong
"668111738,5,2018-6,Hong Kong,""HKDL got different event for different period. Like Jan Feb for Chines New Year, Apr May for Spring Carnival, then Summer, Halloween and Christmas, each event got different theme for both charaters costume and decorate, and sometimes might got the special daily parade too. Thats why recommend to check clearly which event you want to join before you make the disney trip. If you don't like crowded, Mar & November without any event happening will be your choice!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
667962395,3,2019-4,United States,The park is great if this is the only amusement park available to you. It is small and the rides are very tame. The park can be done in 3 4 of a day. Disney is always clean and has the best customer service.,Disneyland_HongKong
"667949538,5,2019-4,Australia,""Visited here with the family and had a very memorable experience. It didn   t seem as big as Anaheim, but very clean and well maintained.  Received priority queuing passes but didn   t need them as the lines were very short."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667897767,4,2019-3,Philippines,""It's always going to be fun at Disneyland. These are a few of my reminders: don't bring selfie sticks and huge tripods you can bring bottled water or if you have a reusable container, use that instead food can be expensive so eat plenty before going here. Just don't ride the rollercoasters right away. don't miss the Festival of the Lion King Show. You can forget the Moana production though if you're expecting the songs from the movie and to see Maui wear comfortable shoes. there will be lots of walking have fun and don't get discouraged by long queues. you'll have your turn sooner than you think."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667633252,4,2019-2,United States,""To be honest it rained nearly all day, if the weather was better i'm sure my overall impression would have been much better. It lacks the thrill seeking rides of other disney parks. That being said it also lacked the ridiculously long quees. Waits were around 5 minutes! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667600609,4,2018-10,United Kingdom,""A super small but cute Disney park   if you're a Disney fan you tick this park off in a day though, be warned, if you're used to the service in Walt Disney World and Disneyland, it doesn't seem to  translate  as well at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food is also not as good   we had lunch from the Lucky Nugget Saloon, which was mediocre at best.A fun day though, regardless."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667509247,4,2019-4,United States,""Plaza Inn was fantastic, and the kids in our group loved the rides. It   s smaller than Disneyland, but if you love Disney, it   s worth the visit. If you   re not super into Disney, I   d probably skip and just go to Disneyland in Anaheim."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667288224,5,2019-3,Australia,""We first did Disneyworld in Orlando some 40 yrs ago with our 2 year old.Back then, we had to buy different value tickets for various rides whereas that has changed and the entry fee now covers all rides etc, except for food. What hasn   t changed. The place is remarkably clean and well maintained given the number of visitors they see each day. Some rides had a long wait ie 40 minutes, so skipped them till later in the day ie 4 5pm, and the wait period was down to less than 10minutes.A very full day. We got there around 10.30 am and left when the street parade finished at around 9.15pm. Exhausting, but simply loved it "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667095433,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,""Had a great time at Disneyland. Great, but can be busy on Saturday and Sunday. Only point to note, is that the park opens at 10:00 but the first zone does not open until 10:30. I purchased priority tickets, if going at the weekend I would recommend priority tickets. Queues smaller during the week and not sure if priority needed."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667093819,4,2019-4,Australia,""We had a terrific time at Disneyland HongKong   rides were fun, waiting times ok, shows were enjoyable, very clean, staff super friendly   only let down was average food but to be expected."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667079818,5,2019-4,Australia,""Even though the rain set in for most of the day, as an adult we still had a fun time at Disneyland Hong Kong"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667072981,3,2019-3,Australia,""Good to see while here, but very small. Great if we brought the children, but not for adults who have been to other ones. Not exciting for bigger children either."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"667023629,5,2019-4,United States,""I love Disney, I even worked at Disney World in college so when we came to Hong Kong I knew we had to visit. I didn't visit the one in Paris when I went and I regret it. Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney Parks. We were able to ride all the rides in 3 hours when we first arrived at 9:30 a.m. I loved the Wondrous Book of Mickey and the Mystic Manor ride. I also liked the new Ant Man and Wasp ride b c it's like the Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger's ride in Orlando. I also liked how all the characters were dressed up for Easter and the Easter decorations they had up as well. I loved both parades, the afternoon and the night time one reminded me of the Electro Magic Parade that was in Orlando. If you're a Disney fan then you must visit Hong Kong Disneyland!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"666934099,5,2019-4,Singapore,""Small disneyland catering to kids, but they have some nice rides including the new Ant Man ride. Pricey food and somewhat long queues but that is part of the theme park. Try to go in the morning and then again in the evening, best is to stay one day at the hotel to maximize the park."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"666902517,4,2019-4,Indonesia,""It was very essay to go from the city to Disney central Station. We bought tickets on sight with the additional VIP Status so that we didn't have to line up.It was a week day and the park was not full  it was heaven. My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well."",Disneyland_HongKong"

I would definitely recommend for a family day out."",Disneyland_HongKong"
666333440,3,2018-8,China,It was ok. This Disney is more catered for smaller children rather than adults. Some of the areas were closed. There was only one really thrilling ride. the rest are for children. Maybe needs a few more western restaurants as well.,Disneyland_HongKong

"666297074,5,2019-1,India,""I would recommend to go through below tips to navigate easily and manage most of your time at this marvellous amusement park.We visited during new year with 2 year old infant so some points could be helpful for fellow travellers.Tip: 1. dont take big luggage or even trolley bag while entering as they wont let you inside plus you have to PAY to use thier storage service also..only BACKPACK (read not too big) is allowed.2. Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

666237713,5,2018-5,Sri Lanka,Superb atmosphere in HK Disneyland. Must enter the park by 8am soon it   s opened and have more than enough things to do until dawn. Better check which amusements are under renovation as usually it has 1 or 2 parks under construction everyday. If this is your last item in HK tour you can check in luggage at Kowloon station and visit Disneyland. But recommend to reserve two day ticket if you want to try out all excursions. Fantastic creation and life time snaps to capture in 48 hours.,Disneyland_HongKong

665910063,4,2019-3,United States,My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.,Disneyland_HongKong
665808902,5,2019-2,United States,Took some family to park for their first time at a Disney park. They loved it and it was a joy to see the kid in their eyes as they enjoyed all that it had to offer. Weather was great as well.,Disneyland_HongKong

"665245861,5,2019-4,Indonesia,""Who wouldn   t enjoy Disneyland? Hong Kong Disneyland is really easy to access. They have special metro to Disneyland and special designed. You better get there before 10 and directly queue until the parks open (at 10), so once it open you can enjoy many rides without long queue. Just be there on weekdays, avoid weekends!For muslim traveler, you shouldn   t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan   s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120 150 HKD if i   m not mistaken. I enjoy big rides but avoid big thrill drop. I   ve tried almost all rides except Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Shame, i   m afraid of fast backward drop lol.

"665132719,5,2019-4,Uganda,""We bought a package through the Disney website. We started at the Explorers lodge and the package included several priority passes (like fast passes). We actually never needed to use them because the longest wait time for a ride was 10 minutes. All of the shows and rides are in English and most cast members speak English really well. This park is the smallest of Disneyland parks in the world, but we still felt like there was enough to keep us busy for our day and a half that we were there. The bus shuttles were very clean and ran on time.Would definitely go again next time we are in Hong Kong."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"664668402,2,2019-4,Singapore,""I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again. Also the balloons there are overrpriced   HK150 for a helium balloon."",Disneyland_HongKong"
664665673,5,2019-4,Canada,We have been to LA and Florida Disney MANY times so we were told we would be disappointed with this one. Not at all! We loved it. It had different rides and shows while still having the same layout and Disney feel. It is expanding a whole lot at the moment. My suggestion would be to add more food restaurants as the food lines were as long as the ride liens. We purchased online tickets and bought a partial ride upgrade. We wanted the full ride upgrade but it was sold out for the day. IMHO it is well worth it! We spent opening to closing there and loved it. The midway games were fun,Disneyland_HongKong

"664378631,5,2019-4,India,""Everyone loves Disneyland !!! If you are traveling with young kids I would really recommend staying at one of the three Disney hotels. The hotels provide coaches, thereby making it more convinient. We stayed at the Disney hotel for two nights, the high point being the visit by the Disney characters at breakfast .  We also took a two day pass, it made the whole experience more relaxed and easy going.  Vegetarian food is only available at one of the restaurants. But the taste and quantity is good.  The park itself is well designed. There are enough options to engage very young kids to older kids.  The parade is not to be missed, as well as the different photo opps with all the Disney characters.  Other than the rides my kids really enjoyed the opportunity to dress up as young Jedi   s n fight the evil forces . A great family vacation. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

There is truly something for everyone of all ages. The lines where very well managed with even on opening day of the new marvel ride just around 40 mins wait. Make sure you use smart fast track passes where you can they are free at some rides.It   s fair to say this park is much smaller than the others but somehow in that it becomes so much more charming.The staff could not do more for people bending over backwards they clearly love their jobs. They just seemed to intuitively just know what people needed.Would strongly recommend anyone with a day or two to spare. The current two day ticket offer was great for us as we did most of the flagship rides day one and the show and on the second day the other items.With this very close proximity to the airport and cheap bag storage it   s an ideal place to stop over or visit on your last day like we did heading straight to the airport after.

664091514,5,2019-4,United States,Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. It is a smaller park but what it loses in size it makes up for in quality. Hong Kong is currently home to the only Marvel themed rides and they do not disappoint. Hong Kong has many of the standard rides shows you expect from Disney but it also maintains a variety of exclusives. Hong Kong also has a lot of exclusive merchandise especially pins. Also most if not all of the rides are Bilingual. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"663693003,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,""Buy your discounted tickets on Klook (thus no ticket queueing when you arrive), get the MTR to Disneyland (35 mins from Hong Kong station where we had breaky at the Pret A Manger in the shopping mall there.). Take in lots of water as it   s expensive in the park. We also took in kids food and snacks as they are expensive and not great quality, you get searched on entry by if you have a good bag with many compartments, it   s easy to hide! Get there at 1015am latest and when the gates open at 1030am go straight for the Star Wars or ToyStory area. Only 2 or 3 rides have the fast pass, if you want to go to the Winnie the Pooh, use it there as the queue was long. Toy story land was great and big queues for the green parachute ride, so that   s one to go to first if you don   t start with Star Wars. The 245pm street show was very good (no need to get there early) but we were disappointed not to see the lion king show that is not currently on (download the free Disney HK App   will tell you what   s happening when). The Lion King show is a not to miss apparently and you have to get there before the street show ends or you might not get in. Recommend the musical show in the big Theatre, that   s next to the Small world. Saw the 1230pm show with lots of singing and Mickey Mouse and goofy !Our highlight of the day though was Mine train  amazing. Went on it 5 times.All in all, a good long day out   too tired to stay for the 730pm lights show !"",Disneyland_HongKong"

663443693,4,2019-4,Australia,This was our first family trip to Disney as a family (hubby and I have been to LA before we had kids). We left the hotel at 8.30 am even though the park didn   t open until 10.30. I   m glad we did as it took a little while to get there and get tickets etc. We bought the Priority line pass for an extra HKD$299 but it was a big waste of money as the park wasn   t busy and we only had to wait once for a ride. As the park wasn   t busy there were many food shops that were not open. Our kids (13 and 10) loved the rides and went of a few of them several times. My 10 year old cried when we were leaving as she didn   t want to go   so she must of had a good day! It was long and our feet hurt by the end of the day because of all the walking but it was definitely worth it to see the kids having such a good time.

Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats.

We had a great time here, but compared to Paris, Tokyo and Florida (the others I've visited) it was very small with a limited number of rides and no real thrill rides. Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park. The staging, live singing and performances were all very impressive.The food options are also really good with lots of variety."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online. I downloaded the app and it was great as a map and to track wait times for the rides. Most rides had 5 to 40 min waits. I recommend getting the fast pass for Dumbo as it was the only line that took MUCH longer than the advertised wait time. We were able to get on all the rides and still make it back on the MTR at a decent time but the train was pretty packed.

We tried with a different card and it still gave the same message. The credit card company said the payment was taken but we had not received a booking confirmation. We took a taxi from TST area and it was not expensive and in an air conditioned car it was a pleasant journey. We arrived about 10:30. The next day at the park we had to waste time at guest relations where we were told the payments had not been taken, so we bought our tickets at the park. We will need to check our card statements to ensure no payments have been taken!We did not know if we should add the priority pass to our tickets as there was no information on how long the queues were at the entrance, unlike parks we have visited in the US, so we purchased them.Whilst at The Iron Man ride the priority cards were scanned on entry then scanned again before getting on. This is where two of the priority rides were recorded as used but it should only have been recorded as once   we did not know this at the time. When we tried to use our priority pass for the 3rd time later we were told we had none left. This was very embarrassing in front of the other park Guests. We said it could have occurred at Iron Man as they scanned it twice and was told to go back to Iron Man! We were tired by this point from going around the park and did not want to walk back there and so said we would go to Guest Relations instead. Guest Relations were not apologetic. We were offered the priority ticket for our next visit but we are from the UK and do not expect to return! We were offered a soft drink or popcorn   whoopy dah! We had just had lunch   no thank you. So we left with it not being resolved to our satisfaction.Please be careful if you buy online and if you have purchased a priority pass!The queues were about 15 30 minutes.We did have a great time at Disney but the pre purchase and priority pass experiences have left us feeling dissatisfied rather than elated and we still need to check payments had not been taken, so our negative Disney experience continues, even once back in the UK for the next few weeks."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"661955342,3,2019-3,Australia,""We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasn't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so don't bother with a tour. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"661666641,3,2019-2,Malaysia,""Visited this theme park on 26.02.19. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular. I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"661255238,5,2019-3,India,""I took my kids to Disneyland on weekday which was a great decision as there was minimum rush. very small queues. we reached there by 10 and started with Tomorrowland. we did all the rides by 5:30pm and left by 6:00 pm. Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons. We went to Royal Banquet hall for food. average food. carry water bottle as water is expensive there."",Disneyland_HongKong"
660968080,4,2019-3,United States,We liked this compared with United States because its easier to navigate because its smaller and there are more rides for little ones. We went on Wed. and the line was short. Only from 5 minutes to 15 minutes wait. Unheard of in the USA. You can get here easily with MTR. Expect to spend a day here. They open at 10 am. The Moana show and the Disney Tale Story Show was our favorite.,Disneyland_HongKong

"660325857,5,2019-3,Hong Kong,""I've seen many negative posts and comments on HK Disneyland in the past. It is really not that bad. Yes, it is expensive and small but it has tons of rides for all ages.As an HK resident, I always go to Hk Disneyland and the experience is the same every time. Whether it is the parade or the rides, the park is incredible. There has been tons of revamps in the past few years with the farewells to Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters but has been replaced with a brand new section in Tomorrowland featuring Iron Man and Ant Man coming in April as well as a brand new revamp of Space Mountain. The staff are extremely helpful and the gift shops have loads of merchandise and souvenirs. The park is also extremely kid friendly. The only negative I can extract from this park is the food price. The food isn't that bad but for it's quality, it is way too expensive. Since visitors aren't allowed to bring food in, you might have to starve for a day or buy an expensive meal.If you have lots of free time in HK and want something enjoyable whether with the kids or with your mates, HK Disney is a great park although if you are a major thrill seeker, Ocean Park would be more suited for you."",Disneyland_HongKong"

To avoid rushing back with other visitors, I tried staying back after the last parade and got on the MTR after most of the visitors had left.The theme park provide strollers for rent, be careful not to lose the deposit slip or they wouldn't cash your deposit when you return the strollers.My kids enjoyed every parade especially the last one at 2000 hrs, with all the lightworks and Disney characters out on the street."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Shows such as Mickey and the Wondrous Book or Lion King are amazing. The parade in the afternoon is also good because we can see all Disney cartoon characters coming out.

659463395,4,2019-3,Australia,This is a smaller park than American Disneyland. My favourite part was the lion king show. It had great costumes acrobatics makeup and props. My grandson does not want to go to Theatre but changed his mind after this show. Staff were sometimes too busy talking to other staff to assist and sometimes abrupt. Overall though we had a great time. I think American Disneyland set a huge standard that was hard to match. ,Disneyland_HongKong

Food is so so, especially for the Starliner restaurant that serves western food. Ticket came with a food coupon for purchase of meal up to $149HK. Bought the recommended value set to maximise it but the burger was so pathetic, small, flat and the meat was half. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

My favourite ride was the Mystic Manor   it has nothing to do with Disney, but a great little story which is a bit funny and has amazing detail in the ride. I believe it   s for HK only so really special. The run away train is quite deceiving, it starts of slow and you start to think it   s a bit rubbish...but it then surprises you. A winner with us. We got our tickets with Klook as this was by far the cheapest. It even came with the option for a meal deal which was did as it mean we didn   t have to worry about that. The food at Disney wasn   t great but ok. They are working on the castle at the moment and think it may take a while. At the moment it   s tiny! We found it so odd seeing the castle like this, but it   s because they didn   t have the money to build a bit castle. They do not so fireworks at the moment because of this but they are doing a light show at Main Street which was good. HK Disney has a toy story land, built before the one in Orlando. It   s really good but I love toy story. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

The only lines we encountered were for the characters. Easy to do in 1 day. Lots of great food options that is not your typical Disney fare. We quite enjoyed the time spent there."",Disneyland_HongKong"

This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm."",Disneyland_HongKong"

It   s the happiest place on earth, and it   s great.It is a small park, at least by Anaheim and Tokyo standards, and can be easily covered in a few hours. This leaves plenty of time for shopping and hitting the rides you like multiple times.We came on a Tuesday in early March and arrived at park open. The weather was nice out, but the lines were, thankfully, almost non existent. Even after the usual busy times of 1 2pm, most lines were less than 15 mins.We bought a priority pass, but in hindsight it wasn   t at all required. In the end we just used it to get the value, but we were really just skipping 5 minute queues, so it was a waste of money on this particular occasion. Perhaps we got lucky and other days would make it worth the money but I am unsure.The RC car and Grizzly were my favourite rides, both extremely thrilling.Disneyland HK is a must see if you   re here, but not the best Disneyland in my experience."",Disneyland_HongKong"

There are enough rides and attractions to make the trip worthwhile, and it is very easily accessible by the MTR Trains. Main disappointment Wes that there were no characters strolling thru the park to mingle with visitors. That may be because of overcast and potentially rainy skies. In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee. In Orlando Florida, people have to buy a ticket for each of the four or five parks they want to visit, That gets really expensive. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

It's said that it's only available in Hong Kong, no other Mystic Manor in any other Disneyland. So we had to go there! Although it wasn't a thrilling ride, it was still fun & very amusing for us. The MM souvenirs were also very cute. We spent quite amount of money there, because no other MM souvenirs at any other Disneyland shop (not even at the shop at the Hong Kong Airport!).

I've already hit Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, this is my fourth location (Tokyo in 2020 and Shanghai 2021). Although this park is slightly larger than Anaheim it doesn't really feel like it. They have fewer attractions crammed into a small space like the original. Overall the park is clean, themed well and all the cast members we came into contact with were pleasant. I don't think you can compare Disney parks to each other, it's just not fair. I like the HK version although a lot of the attractions were mirror images (or very close) to rides in other Disney parks. Although they are branching out with the Iron Man Experience (think Star Tours with Iron Man) and the new Ant Man and Wasp attraction (which was not yet open when we went in February 2019.) Mystic Manor is HK's answer to the Haunted Mansion. It has a compelling story with a character (Albert the monkey) that draws you in and it has great effects. HK DL is almost worth it just for this one attraction, we rode it twice.

As to for the mascots, finally saw them at the end of our day and only in the    town    part.Costumes were ruined by staff wearing black running shoes. OK they are on their feet and need to be comfortable but it was seriously jarring. Staff get a 2 10.Things like the recycling bin being loaded and taken away to be emptied but not one put in to replace. Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money.

We contemplates doing a VIP tour as we had done in WDW, but left it too late to book and in the end glad that I didn't waste my money here as it just wasn't needed unless you were to go on one of the Chinese holidays.We stayed in HK central and took the train out which was easy to do with them running every few minutes, it really didn't matter if you missed one. Even the return at night despite all the people it was frequent enough that there was never a significant wait. The People are somewhat pushy though it's some form of FOMO(fear or missing out). The train doors open people push in and out. If you finish one ride it seems you need to run to the next one so you can get ahead of 2 people. Rope drop which would normally allow a flow of people into the park was more like the starting gun of the New York Marathon.That said, we loved the park. Favorite ride is Phantom Manor, similar type of ride to Ratatouille in France but with some magical effects. The light show at night is also worth staying to check out.As a tall person 6' 4  I did find myself having to contort myself into seats to fit my legs in. Same thing with Tokyo, but you can fit. I found crossing my legs and moving my feet as far back in the seat as I could before sitting down made a difference.The Lion King show was amazing so I would put that down as a must!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"655849465,3,2019-2,United Kingdom,""I   m a big Disney fan so was super excited to visit HK Disneyland. Although we had a fun day.. I can   t help but feel disappointed. The park was very small and I feel the price is extortionate when comparing it to Disneyland Paris   which is much larger and significantly cheaper. I found that it didn   t have the magic of Disney and it just felt like any old theme park. The staff were not particularly friendly and they didn   t engage with guests at all   in fact, I was ignored by a group of 3 staff members! Having said this.. mystic manor is quite possibly my new favourite Disney ride ever   you really have to go on it!! "",Disneyland_HongKong"

We thought that the park will be packed since is the holiday season but luckily the park is moderately packed.My thought about this place is a great place to spend your day in your HK trip. The park is very nice and it was smaller than your typical Disney park. Compared to other Disney park I've ever visited, this theme park has shortest waiting time especially for thrill seeker attraction and of course no need to check all the fast pass.You can download the apps beforehand to check the schedule for the parade, map, and waiting time for each attraction. Unfortunately in our visit, the Sleeping Beauty castle is still under construction but we managed to enjoy Disney Christmas Celebration.In our visit, We managed to enjoy 6 rides, 1 parade, 2 shows in our 4 hours of visit. If You're a thrill seeker, don't forget to enjoy the two attractions exclusive in HK Disneyland, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor. For a magical time of great fun, you can   t go wrong with Hong Kong Disneyland!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Crowds were OK for mid week and winter. Cost HK619 for the day each adult. We ate in the explorers club restaurant and had an Asian curry which was OK although a bit bland to cater for all tastes.

"654876699,4,2019-2,United States,""I personally haven't gone to a Disneyland outside of California so I didnt know what to expect. The cultural ties to the Chinese culture that they implemented at the park was simply amazing. This is probably the only park where Mickey can speak Cantonese. The park is very clean, it was smaller than your typical Disney park. There are various shows you can watch throughout the park. The rides are similar to what you would find in California. I believe the Iron Man attraction might be unique to HK. The park was busy but not to the point where we had to wait hours for a ride. It averaged 30 minutes or so per ride. If you're looking to experience something different from Disney, this would be the place to go. We only went for the day and was able to go on everything we wanted to go on. Just keep in mind that this park is smaller. I would not recommend coming here during Chinese New Year or Golden Week."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"654750950,5,2019-2,United States,""I   ve visited every Disney park except Shanghai and this is perhaps my favorite for a toddler. It   s a close replica of the Anaheim Disneyland but smaller without some of the big kid rides. PROs:1) For a Disney park, it   s not very crowded. I love Tokyo Disney Sea but the crowds really kill the experience there. People in Hong Kong apparently do not wake up early even when the park opens at 930am. There   s really are no lines for the first couple hours. Even during the busiest hours, the lines are moderate. 2) I love the variety of foods from all different regions. I actually looked forward to meals. 3) When we were there, they were 6 different times for the Jedi training and it was never full. 4) Admission tickets are so much cheaper than any other Disney park in the world. You can use apps like Klook to buy discount tickets and discount meals. If your children are under 7, this really is the perfect Disney experience. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

If you are family with kids, it's a must visit place, you can meet almost all Disney characters, and don't forget to capture your moments, there are so many beautiful photo spot to be captured. Suggestion: you'd better come in the morning, since the weather is not too hot and there will be more crowded in the afternoon. And if you are not in rush, be sure to see the parade or the fireworks show in the night (about 30 minutes before the closing time), that's really worth the wait, and I can say that's one of the best show I have ever seen."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We went in February on a damp day. Not overly busy, with queue times between 0 and 10 minutes without any kind of priority boarding ticket. Having been to Disney Land Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida I was still hugely impressed and couldn   t stop smiling for the whole visit. A real mixture of East and West themes going on, similar in so many ways but different enough to make it still feel new. There was some building work going on around the castle and as a result the train wasn   t working though that didn   t detract from the day. Log in to the Disney Land Wi Fi and we got a HK$10 voucher. Thoroughly enjoyed Toy Story Land. The classic area of Tomorrow Land rebranded as Star Wars & Marvel.

You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park.

We dropped off our luggage right before the entrance to Disneyland for a reasonable fee there is a special place at Disney to hold your luggage for the day. Small Disneyland compared to Anaheim and Florida but definitely fun to see and experience. The food inside the park was disappointing.

Disneyland HK is smaller than the two parks in the US. It was oddly similar, and yet oddly different. The park was clean. Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I don't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando!

"650641639,4,2019-1,United States,""I've gone to both Disney parks in California and Orlando and while HK Disneyland is very small in comparison, I loved how this park won't have you exhausted by the end of the day and still allow for other activities after you've finished your time. This was how I scheduled my time with my friend. 11 am met a friend at Nam Cheong MTR and rode over to the Disneyland Line. A smart thing to do would be to buy your tickets on your phone as you are riding the MTR. (We didn't and wasted some time at the ticket gate)Once we were in we took our rounds of pictures. The first impression was,  Wow, that's the castle? How awful.  Though when I was there they blocked off the castle so they will be making a more robust castle soon from what I'm understanding.In other parks like Japan and the USA, it's all about looking for the snacks all around the park. (Here's looking at you Dole Whip) I need to get this out of the way, the food is awful at HK Disney. This fact really surprised me given that there's so much good food in HK but it really was pretty horrid. Friend and I had some bad lunch and then went along to other rides. Most rides were about a 20 minute wait which I thought was very acceptable. I think the longest wait we had was for Hyperspace Mountain and that was for 40 minutes.Checked out the parade and was actually hoping for Asian women dressed up as Cinderella or Snow White. Nope. God forbid Snow White is an Asian. But I suppose I get it. lolAfter some snack fails and a Philharmagic 3D show we exited the park at around 6 pm. Took the MTR straight to Tsim Sha Tsui for a nice dinner at 7 pm. At 9 pm, friends and I were parked at a whisky bar and then by 11:30 pm I was home in bed.It was one of the most amazing days because this type of Disney excursion never happens in either California or Florida simply give the scale of the parks and also how awful public transportation is in either cities.I wouldn't recommend coming to HK for Disneyland, that would be a let down. However, if you're sightseeing in HK and have time for Disney, it's a no brainer to go."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"650483884,5,2019-1,United Arab Emirates,""Our 3 year old daughter loves all of the Disney princesses so we had to take her to Disneyland. She had an absolute blast and probably loved the parade best because she got to see all the princesses.Unbeknownst to us we were in Hong Kong the week leading up to Chinese New Year so the city was packed but it didn   t really affect our Disney trip in any way other than it was probably much busier for a Monday than it normally would be.Disneyland Hong Kong is now where near as big as the original or Disney World Orlando, we haven   t yet been to Paris or Tokyo Disney   s so we can   t compare to them. Even though the park isn   t as big as the two in America it   s not missing anything for our 3 year old but it would be lacking in rides and activities for older kids to teens.

I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I couldn't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they can't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code wouldn't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays.

There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something.

"647569763,4,2018-2,United Arab Emirates,""I visited this superb amusement and theme park two times already. On this last visit , I took my 86 yr old father with me. He enjoyed like a child. The whole area is divided into 7 zones and each of the zones is uniquely planned and designed with the speciality of that zone in mind. Each zone has a ride, a show , an eatery for that area. I loved the Grizzly bears mining area with that stupendous ride!! The zone is planned with hot water geizers and rocky mountainous type. Excellent. Also the space ride area was too good. Starwars themed people were going around. The ride was great. I also liked the Little children's boat rides. The shows were a little less exciting for us. Because it's really for the small kids. There is a nice rail line around the park for easy travel. We bought the online tickets from the website. That made the enty super easy. Also I had the priority pass for us  that's free, my father had the senior ticket very cheap. The passes really helped us to see everything fast. U need to walk around a lot. But lots of resting places and refreshments are available to take it slow. Protect your head with hats.One day finishes like a sweet dream. Interested people can take the two day ticket if so inclined. There is also a hotel inside which can be included in the package. At designated times there are themed festivities, procession and fireworks which attracts lot of crowds. The journey from the city takes around 1 hr. Discounted tickets are available from klook dot com also. Overall, a lifetime dream came true for me. I have been dreaming of going to disneyland from the last 40 yrs minimum. I am very happy.

"647328225,1,2019-1,Australia,""Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience.

Space Mountain is a combination of Space Mountain and Star Wars. Quite hysterical Hearing R2 D2in your ear while riding in the dark. The haunted house is a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark style seating and has some of the facts of the haunted house. The jungle cruise is way better then California Disney. The whole Adventure Land is very green and Lush. The Toy Story Land is incredible. Full of lots of great rides. The Thunder Mountain is amazing and much better than California.

There is really no other option unless one takes the subway off site It is also hard to find a willingness in the employees to accommodate special diets such as gluten free. Our granddaughter has celiacs and we asked for ice cream in a dish rather than a cone. You would think we had asked for something unbelievably difficult for them to do. They would only give us the ice cream in a cardboard paper french fry container and not in a plastic cup that they used to serve sundaes in.

But, this time, I think it is worth the price of admission and a great getaway. There's several Hong Kong only rides that you have to do. Comparing to Shanghai Disney, I prefer this one a little more. We spent two days here and could have stayed a little longer. So, if you are a Disney fan, do not count this Disney as the little one. It has pure Disney heart."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"645245762,5,2019-1,United Kingdom,""My husband and I had a long layover at the airport, so we left our bags at the Left Luggage counter in Terminal 2 and caught a blue taxi to Disneyland. I   ve visited both Disney parks in the States many times, so I was excited to see the similarities and differences at the Hong Kong park.We arrived around 2:30 pm, and there was absolutely no queue. The ticket counter employee kindly informed us that there was no need to purchase fast pass tickets given the small number of guests at the park that day. And she was right! The longest queue was for 25 minutes for Winnie the Pooh. Otherwise, we walked right on to rides or waited 5   10 minutes. I have never seen a Disney park less crowded (we visited on January 9th).Like all Disneys, the park is charming and well done. There is a LOT of construction right now, including the castle and construction in Tomorrowland. There is a strong focus on photographs   so many character meet and greets and photo opportunities everywhere. Perhaps this is due to the new Instagram focused world we live in. It was fascinating to see so many dressed up guests ready for their pictures   high heels, designer dresses, lipstick, etc. This is not your normal turkey leg eating guest at the Florida park. :)The park appears to be quite small compared to CA Disneyland. We spent about 3.5 hours at the park and we were ready to go (we only rode the majority of the rides once). The roller coasters were a bit more exciting than those in the States   Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (which looks like Thunder Mountain Railroad) is much more exciting. It was also interesting to see the similarities and differences between Mystic Manor and the Haunted Mansion. There were also a few new rides and experiences that I hadn   t seen in the States.I   m glad we didn   t take a full day out of our initial visit to Hong Kong to visit Disney, but it was the perfect place to spend a long layover.

"645088792,5,2019-1,Australia,""Smaller and with much less    challenging    rides than Ocean Park, HK Disneyland nevertheless really delivers.We went to HKDL only a couple of days after OP and thought it might be theme park overkill, but easily managed to keep going from before opening (we arrived 15    prior to 10.30am start) until closing after the final street parade. The family, including 17, 20 and 22 year olds, each had an awesome time. The lines were short (a Thursday in January), the weather perfectly in the Goldilocks zone, the rides fun albeit not too much of a challenge, and the vibe was ideal (how can you not get into it when fully 10 20% of the adult guests are wearing Mickey  Minnie ears or other HKDL headgear?!). I can even recommend forking out slightly extra in buying the combo food package (something I normally eschew), and definitely suggest it   s well worth purchasing online prior to going. If you can only go to one park I   d suggest HKDL on balance (cleaner, easier, fewer queues and less walking), unless you   re after more of a    local    flavour or want more thrill seeking rides. Ideally do both and make your own comparisons. Either way, enjoy the ride!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

It   s easy to get to (take the train from HK central to Sunny Bay, on the Tung Chung line, then change at Sunny Bay, then the purpose built Disneyland line (Mickey theming literally everywhere!) to the resort. It   s around 600$HK which is around   60 or US$75 for a one day pass, and one day is really all you need. (They do sting you a little on the locker charges though). It has all the Disney touches you   d expect at a Disney park, but it   s very small and compact. I was lucky that the day I visited crowds were low. I never queued more than 10min for anything. Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride were great, Tomorrowland is probably the best for adult guests. The mine train in Grizzly Gulch is great too. Mystic Manor will seem strange if you   re used to the Haunted Mansion, but it has its own charm. Almost everything is kid friendly and Fantasyland seems to take up a larger proportion of the park than in Florida or California.

The Mickey light show in main street was excellent and very well done but sadly the night show that we waited for was cancelled 2 mins before it was due to start because of about 3mins of a VERY light rain shower. We have visited Florida Disney many times and it is obviously far superior but the main comment I have to say is that every single staff member at Hong Kong looked miserable and that they didn't really want to be there, by comparison Florida staff are bursting with smiles and fun. Not many large rides here and only two fast pass rides. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was just average food.

We booked our tickets online through Klook, which proved effortless as we showed our QR codes to gain enterance and off we went. We were inside the main enterance just after gate opening. We had been to Disneyland California and roughly knew the rides we wanted to get on, so headed straight for them. We rode quite a few of the rides with little to no waiting time and made our way around the park easily picking rides depending on wait time. We only had the 1 day, so if you do too, I suggest you wear comfortable shoes. Yes, it   s a smaller park but there   s still kilometers to walk.

Some rides opened early while others opened a little later. The castle was under construction, so that isn't a good picture right now. We did the Ironman ride which was very fun and there was no line at all. It seems that since Shanghai Disney opened it isn't as crowded at Hong Kong Disney. We did all the big rides that we wanted to do and funny enough the longest line was for Jungle Cruise. Haha! Our new favorite ride is Mystic Manor, a new and terrific version of Haunted Mansion. It is really well done! Be sure you see it! We loved the park! We made a reservation at Crystal Lotus but didn't have a cute dim sum reservation so we were not able to get that. I wrote a separate review on that restaurant. We had done the whole park and shopped by 1 pm. As we headed out to go to the Disneyland Hotel around 1pm, the crowds coming in were insane! Apparently everyone arrives late and stays late. So we were very happy to come early and leave early. Happy that we went, and enjoyed it! We got discount tickets from Klook.com in advance.

Our favorite rides were the Grizzly Gulch, Hyperspace Mountain, and Iron Man Experience. My number one tip is to get there right at 10:00. No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good.

The Mystic Manor ride was good but the queue was abysmal, and not very clearly signposted. The riverboat ride was fantastic, largely because of the guide who deserves either an Oscar or a pay rise for her brilliant commentary. The Runaway Mine Carts ride was extremely good fun, and very well done in terms of safety. Most queues moved surprisingly quickly, and it was all relatively painless, even for a Disney cynic like me.

A couple of them just came out a few minutes for picture shoots and headed back in. The on line videos showed Disney characters just walking around the park, interacting with people, making the ambiance of the park more Disney like. This was actually the expectation. I was expecting Cylons, Jedis, Mickey, Minne. Goofy, etc to been seen in the park. But unfortunately, we actually had to look for them.The entertainment in itself was not bad.

The look of delight in my three year old   s face was also sweet. It was a fantastic warmer for the bigger parks in the U.S.A. One day park? Definitely not. We did every single ride (apart from RC Racer and Tarzan   s House) and every single show (apart from Moana) and parades, net characters, did none of the gardens and we just fit it into two days. And we were there from open to close with a stack of fast passes in hand. Maybe we were slowed down due to having little kids with us but I don   t know how people do the park in one day and do it justice. Where the park lost a star was the food and merchandise. The food was gross. That   s all I can say about that. The merchandise? Well unfortunately there were heaps of shops on Main Street but they all stocked exactly the same merchandise. Apart from Pandora which I don   t personally wear, there was nothing for adults. The variety just wasn   t there and the selection that was there was poor. Would I go back?

642534419,2,2018-12,Singapore,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back! Please do not visit during the Christmas New Year season!,Disneyland_HongKong

It's a great place for children with various rides shows eateries which are family and child friendly. My only tip is to try and go on a weekday as the crowds in the weekend are understood to be really massive. I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones.

My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children.

Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland. Overall it   s a must visit place if you are in Hong Kong."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"638438046,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,""As a resident of Hong Kong, and very close to Disneyland, we   ve been visiting here often ever since it opened. We used to have yearly passes for the whole family. It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Watch out for the time allotted for different shows.The shows were fantastic, the circle of life is even more fantastic.There will be long queue for every show it is an advantage to get a fast pass to escape the long line. Except for picture taking with Minnie and Mickey Mouse you have to endure the long queue because there   s no fast pass for this.The jungle river experience is a must!

That said we had a great time, we brought a 2 day pass as there was not much difference in price of 1 day before we went, we also purchased the food package of 2 meals and a snack. The food you get with this deal is very filling and we struggled to get through all the food we could have. The snack was either popcorn or an ice cream and the meals were full size dinners with soft drink. Everything that we ate was very tasty.Possibly the 1 meal and a snack option would have suited us better.It was very quiet there when we went and hardly had to queue for the rides and didn   t need to use fast passes at all.decorations for Christmas were really good but I was disappointed that there was not much In the way of Disney Christmas ornaments to purchase.All in all we had a great time, I still can   t get over how small the castle is, I thought the one in Paris was small but it   s huge in comparison to the one here."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The Park itself is beautiful, so are most of the shows  I loved Magic Manor and my daughter loved the Lion King show. The parade was great, but a bit too short. A few things went bad though  lots of waiting for every ride  15 25  minutes. Kids got tired and we gave up on some rides. The food is overpriced and tasted bad  The Main Dining Hall (up to 20 USD for a tasteless meal), food stalls with outdated corn for 4 USD 4, sausages 5 USD. Actually all soft drinks in the Park cost HKD 32 ( 4  USD) and you are not allowed to bring your own food! Another point  it's close to Christmas time, a lot of Christmas music was being played non stop including Church hymns like Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, O Come All Ye Faithful, etc. Sounds too religious, not suitable for kids, a bight of brainwashing so to say. And no wi fi at the park at all.

It helped that we bought our tickets online (and cheaper) as we were able to skip the ticket counters and breezed through the entrance. We were greeted by rows of souvenir shops and rows of cheery greeters before the kids raced towards the rides. Us adults appreciated that there is (already) a Starbucks along the Main Ave which provided a caffeine respite every now and then.

The VIP experience is worth it, especially if the park is busy. Be sure to get the armbands for the parade   you get the best seats possible with no jockeying.5.

Thunder Mountain was my absolute favorite ride (for slightly older kids and adults) and the shows were great! We saw the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book! Both amazing! The Moana show was ok but Moana didn   t sing so we left. Good food options and lots of lands to explore. Definitely smaller than Disney so if you start early you could see most of the park in a day.

636961092,5,2018-12,India,Our visit to Disneyland was planned solely for son who   s 4 year old. That we would also have so much fun was not known The whole environment is one of gala and celebrations. The different worlds created within Disneyland make for one new experience after the other. It is humanly impossible to do all the rides and there is a fair bit of walking in between the different    lands    and quite a wait for the very popular rides. You can you the fast access to plan though. The only downer was the food options. If you are fussy you should plan your movement through Disneyland to be around the restaurant that serves food that you like. The dining options are a bit pricey for the fare offered but that   s come to be expected of all entertainment parks et al. The rides themselves are brilliant. My wife is particular got nostalgic when she did the small world ride again after 15 odd years. The Iron man ride is a do not miss ride. Couple of pieces of advise:A. Plan your route. For eg. come to the Iron man ride in the evening. Nearly no waiting around that time. Plan where you want to have lunch and decide the route for covering the various lands.B. Plan which rides and attractions you want to cover or are must do. C. Get hold of the maps once you enter and the show timings. There are different shows and the timings vary. Also the popular ones go full sometimes 30 mins in advance. D. And finally see the timing of the parades. There a few in the evening. The grand finale at the park closing time is not to be missed. It gets crowded there so try and get there to get a good path side place. Honestly it   s near impossible to cover the park in a single day. Even most good ones would take a day to cover even at a rapid pace. Two days would give you the ability to cover the park in a relaxed manner. Goes without saying a must do. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"636957064,5,2018-11,United States,""We are a Disney loving family so this was a must do for us. The park opens later than other Disney parks which worked out for us because we could actually sleep in on vacation. The park is small but absolutely lovely. I found that our only negative was some pushy guests at parade time. There were virtually no lines for most rides. Our hotel gave us fastpasses but we didn   t need a single one. Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters. Cast Members were friendly but not quite up to the usual Disney standard. Overall, wonderful but small park, easily done in a full day. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"636822111,4,2018-11,United Kingdom,""We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasn't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you couldn't find the end of the line. If you want to get gifts and don't want to queue there is a hong kong disney store at the airport with the same prices and a fair bit of stock."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We didnt stand in a line for longer than 20 minutes.

We thoroughly enjoyed the mine cart in the grizzly grouch area, as well as the star wars ride and the toy story horse shoe.The parades   we watched both the day and night parades   were absolutely spectacular and definitely worth going to   just a tip though is to find a spot about 30 minutes before the parade is due to start as there are alot of people.Also try and find a spot towards the end of main street USA where the road splits to the different parks as the last few floats and characters dont go all the way to the bottom of the road.We also managed to watch two of the shows. The Lion King which was amazing and then Moana which was great but the Lion King was definitely a way better experience.The only let down was that the characters are not walking around so they were only available for short time slots and for a limited amount of people so you had to try and plan your day around this."",Disneyland_HongKong"

During our visit in October 2018 there was construction work being carried out on the Princess Castle, so there was no firework display in the evening.

The kids are young so they rode on rides that suited their age group. Not a huge variety of food but there are a few restaurant cafes around. My only safety concern was lack of security guards or police presence. I caught a man taking pictures of my child along with other kids while watching the Moana live show. He was on his own not accompanied by a child or family. He was taking photos of young teenagers too. I confronted him to delete but he didn   t speak English. Managed to delete but this didn   t stop him doing it again. We spotted him a few times. While waiting for our turn on rides 2 other I saw two native people taking photos of my own children I asked them to stop and intervened but again people don   t speak English. They   d stare like it was completely normal and I   m over reacting. It made me very upset, angry and furious and this behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when it comes to children.

Most of the rides in Small World are the same sans Peter Pan. Their rides in some of the areas are different. Food is really bad. Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show. We were so bored and the singing was mediocre so we left. This is the 4th of the Disney parks we   ve been to and easily ranks at the bottom. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

It might be lacking if you're after big thrills. The food was generally ok and not at astonishing prices.As it got dark we went back and had a second ride on all the things we wanted and some we had missed earlier in the day. All 3 parades we good and as it wasn't too busy everyone was able to see fine. Highlights: The Lion King show (don't miss this and it's a good airconditioned break), Mystic Manor and the Jungle River cruise (make sure you go after dark, it's much better). As people have mentioned HK Disneyland doesn't really have the characters just walking around the Park like you find in other Disneylands, so if getting pics with them is your thing you will have to line up at specific locations and times. The train out there was good, and wasn't even packed after closing time (we walked slowly back to the station).

The lines were pretty short (we were there on a Monday), the longest we waited was 20 minutes but some rides we just walked on. The shows and parades were pretty good. Except the snow show at 6:15pm. Not worth waiting around for. The park was clean, the toilets were clean, plenty of food stores (overpriced but that goes with the territory)Best rides were Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch and the Iron Man one in Tomorrow Land. My daughter said the only negative was that there were no thrill rides like a major roller coaster. Getting there via the MTR was super easy.

633170265,1,2018-11,United Kingdom,Having visited Disneyland Paris some 25 years ago we decided to spend the last day of our holiday at Disneyland Hong Kong. The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff.

Hit the ones you want to go first early to beat the crowds. I went for halloween and there was a good 2 for 1 deal on disney   s site that allows me to enter the park a second time before the end of this year. For popular characters expect at least 30 min to 1 hour waits to take pictures with them (eg. jack and sally for halloween). disney staff give out lots of stickers and candy during halloween. the villains night parade at the end is not as exciting as the one during the day or their regular one as the floats with the villains are plain comparatively. ,Disneyland_HongKong

We arrived in the morning as soon as the park was opening and went through the ticket queue fairly fast. But the crowd was growing much quicker than expected, and later on we found out we chose a public holiday weekend so the crowds were much bigger than usual! We would advise to research this before you plan your trip because it definitely tested our patience and dampened our spirits at times. Because of this, the queues for every single ride were anywhere from 30 minutes several hours long, and it was a very hot day. We anticipated having to line up at Disneyland but the public holiday really made things 10 times slower. But when your at Disneyland, not even that can get you down, it   s just so magical and happy! One ride in each    land    had the option for you to scan your ticket and it would give you another ticket with a time frame on it, so you   re able to go and do other things then come back to skip the line within that time frame. We were then able to go on all the main rides and explore each land. There were so many amazingly fun rides to experience, as well as photo meet and greets with favourite Disney characters such as Eeyore, r2d2, iron man and more. Tarzan   s treehouse is just brilliant, toy story land is every big kids dream and we were lucky enough to see Disneyland at Halloween time, which was spectacular! We spent all day there and upon reflection, would   ve planned to spend 2 full days, regardless of the public holiday. Disneyland truly is what you imagine it to be and more!

So it's just eating to survive, and your tastebuds are not taken into consideration. We managed to take all the rides we wanted to, and still take in some shows before the park closed. In the evening, the lines were much longer, because HK residents came for the evening with their annual passes. It can rain anytime in HK, so pack a raincoat if you have it.

But during my visit there, several sections, such as Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.To make matters worse, the closure was done during the prime time of the park, around 2 3 pm all the way to the dark around 6 pm, and in some cases even until Disney closed. I was very disappointed in this, and I would like to see some responsibilities from Disney regarding this issue. Disney should've given a certain reduction on the hotel price and or Day Pass price due to this  incomplete magical experience ."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits. You CAN bring in water (I took in three bottles and showed them when entering and was let straight through) and a small amount of food, just don't bring a picnic. Sure the food is overpriced and substandard but this IS expected in theme parks.

My wife enjoyed the jungle ride and the cup and saucers as we always seen it on T.V.

"629547840,2,2017-11,Hong Kong,""Yikes, the worst thing about HK Disneyland is the never ending same same music, over and over again, the same tunes. Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long.

"629385659,5,2018-10,Hong Kong,""I spent a magical day At Hong Kong Disneyland with my brother and his family. I had reservations about Hong Kong Disney as I have been to the other Disney parks and this one is obviously much smaller than what I am used to in the context of the magic of Disney!However, whilst small, it   s perfectly formed and there is still huge variety of things to do across the park. I would say it   s particularly geared for smaller children as the size suits their ability to get around the park and do everything. Highlights were the Flights of Fantasy parade (magical), toy story land (in particular the parachute ride) and It   s a Small World (my all time favourite!). It   s everything you would expect from Disney in a really nice bite sized dose which makes it perfect for a 1 day visit. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"629073732,5,2018-10,United States,""Reading online I felt there was a huge feeling of inferiority to this Disneyland compared to its American counterparts but I can honestly say I had a great time! It may look small on a map but I would say it felt about the same size as Disneyland California. There is so much to see and do our only downtime was sitting down to eat twice the whole day. I would say if you are a hardcore Disney fan it can be a two day park but you can definitely do it justice in one.My favourite rides (in order) were Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Car, Hyperspace Mountain and The Iron Man Experiece**. We headed straight to The Iron Man Experience and Mystic Manor when we first got to the park and faced minimal wait time   When we returned later on in the day queues had built up but we stayed onsite at the Hollywood Hotel which provided us with Fast Passes which came in very handy in these instances.** Shout out to It   s A Small World and the Dumbo rides that hold a special place in my heart too**The shows at Hong Kong Disney were amazing too   Check out Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book and Mickeys PhilharMagic. I can   t remember enjoying shows at other Disney Parks as much. The We Love Mickey show was cool too and didn   t involve having to fight with crowds for a space down Main Street   the show is literally projected into the surrounding buildings so you can stand wherever you like. At the end of the day there was a Villains Night Out show keeping with the Halloween theme and involving popular villains from your favourite Disney movies. It was a lot of fun but mostly in Chinese so apart from a whole lot of cackling I wasn   t really too sure what was going on! (Shout out to Cruella who was giving it 100!!!)As well as the shows there were parades to see too. Mickeys Flight of Fancy was the best. Again, keeping with Halloween, there was a Halloween Street Party down Main Street which was fun but could have been avoided. The Hong Kong Disneyland app came in very useful when planning my day at Disney, providing show parade times and where they were located. As you can probably tell I am a Disney fan. I honestly had a great time and feel like people are a tad harsh in relation to this park (I was constant told not to expect too much). My only disappointments are:1) the size of Sleeping Beauty castle and the fact there was a lot of construction going on around it (   pardon our dust we are creating magic   ). As my partner pointed out the 15ft fence probably made the already small castle look even smaller but I am sure once they are finished it will look amazing and I will definitely be back to see for myself! 2) Despite the Disney Corporation priding themselves in magic and customer service I was a disappointed to not see this fully reflected in this park. Overall customer service was lacking in Hong Kong as a whole and I understand culturally it is a different world, but I was constantly disappointed in the rudeness I experienced during my trip and think it something that needs to be worked on at this park in order to keep in with the Disney magic."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The MRT trip from downtown Kowloon is simple to say the least and took about 50 mins. The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element.

"626390967,5,2018-10,Australia,""Disneyland in Hong Kong is a Fabulous opportunity for Australasia to experience the joys of a Magical World away from bars, clubs and casinos! It is where Adults can be kids and kids to be thrilled by the magic. Firstly, if you are not staying in the Disney resort it is wise to buy your tickets online, also include your meal in the ticket as it is easier and cheaper. The package also includes a drink or ice cream AND a $50 voucher to spend at the Disney shop.We arrived close to opening time to beat the crowds but also remember the grand parade and fireworks are late evening, so check the show times and choose your arrival time accordingly. There is only one train connection in and out of Disneyland, don't stress about missing it as it runs every 10 mins etc. Entry during non peak season is quick, but beware bags are checked and no picnics, outside food or big drinks allowed.Once, inside the FUN begins, grab a map, review show times then run amok. If you are in a big family group like we were, separate and meet up when you  bump  into each other or at a arranged time as not every ride is suitable for everyone.The outer restaurants are quieter and are like food markets, make sure you take your voucher to validate if applicable.Queues for rides in October wasn't to long a wait between 5   25 mins, depends on type of ride as the more fast action rides went quicker as little kids could not go on them. The Dumbo ride was the best, simple BUT Fun. If you want the adrenalin rush then the Star Wars ride and the old Cabin Rail ride will do the trick. Skip the Halloween walk through journey, it's in Chinese with only one character speaking English. The  It's a Small World After All  ride in Fantasyland is so CUTE!Time flies and in no time the day ends as everyone is tired and themed park out.tyThanks to the Security staff who let our devastated 6 year old nephew re enter at the exit gate with his parents to search for his Disney cap he had left behind while posing for a photo just before exiting.

"625303443,4,2018-10,India,""We took a 2 day ticket as we were not sure with one day it can all be covered. The first day, we reached by 10 AM and being a weekday it was not very crowded. Its Halloween time and the place had parades and decorations for Halloween. Started with start trek and iron man rides and it was good. Remember, these rides are not as thrilling as the Universal studio and intended for young children (this is Disney!) Then proceeded to the shows and realized that shows get full if you don't reach early. The Moana show had very little seating and the security staff especially one male was kind of rude to people who were walking around. I guess they need to remember that they are not police and kids come with a lot of hope to see this. Not all staff are very fluent in English and when they speak in English they sound rather rude. (Don't stand here, I DON'T know, Move away! etc are the words you hear). Some of them really need a lesson on being 'polite while being assertive'.The food options as written by many others are disappointing for people who do not eat pork and beef, there are very few chicken options. We tried the Asian cuisine restaurants and they are very average when it comes to quality of food. For vegetarians, it's a day of fasting!! (kidding, but it is almost true).If you book from Disney site, you get $15 x2 coupons. The main street store refused to take more than one coupon for a transaction, I argued and they called the manager who confirmed the rule!   one coupon per transaction. But to my surprise on the second day of my visit another store inside (star trek or the fantasy land one) accepted 2 coupons on my wife's ticket. Surprising. Again I think its English language proficiency that is the culprit. Unpleasant experience.The parades were excellent, especially the 8 PM Halloween parade. Shows were also really good and I guess more than rides these are the things you shouldn't miss while in Disneyland.The second day was a Saturday and we could clearly see the difference in the crowd. It was crowded from 10 AM itself. We had only a few stuff pending and finished everything by lunchtime. Overall, it was a 1 and a half day visit and in my opinion, if you are not so particular about missing out a couple of rides you can cover this park in 1 Day itself   try to visit on a weekday.  MTR is connected to the park and transportation to the city is very easy.   There was no free Wi FI  The HongKong Disneyland app on Android can give you details of the shows. It just keeps crashing often on my Samsung phone but for a day it's manageable.  No food or drink allowed to be carried inside, Its mentioned everywhere but I still saw people getting caught in the security and wasting time in disposing off.  Many rides and attractions can be closed for public on a certain day due to 'private' events, details are updated on daily basis on the website and app. Check beforehand and plan.  You should be going at least 20 mins early for the shows, they get filled up fast."",Disneyland_HongKong"
625141875,5,2018-10,Australia,I have been to Disneyland in Los Angeles so I can only compare the Hong Kong site to the original. I enjoyed this Disneyland very much. The staff were always friendly and helpful. We had a mix up with our pre bought tickets and they went out of their way to help us resolve the issue even offering us express passes to some of the popular rides. Having been there in October they had a Halloween theme throughout the park and line ups to rides were not long as it was out of the holiday season for Hong Kong residents. They were giving away lots of stickers and lollies in the Halloween themed garden where kids could make up small baskets to go trick or treating. This was all free. Food is standard theme park menu items. We had burgers and fries which was decent enough.The theme park is near the airport direction and it cost us approx $50AUD each way from our hotel in Mong Kok via Uber (we had 6 people and needed a large van).There is also complimentary wi fi throughout the park.Its a long and tiring day when you are there from 10:30am until 8:30pm at night but it is worth it to see all the parades as well as the rides and features. I recommend to attend over two days as we didn't get to see all the themed sections in the first day. The kids loved it and so did us adults.,Disneyland_HongKong
625139064,4,2018-10,Philippines,Disneyland Hong Kong is small compared to other Disneyland we visited. When we visited it wasn't that clean. Leaves from the trees are scattered in the alley.

For that reason, I think the size of the area of HK Disneyland is perfect. It might be slightly smaller than other Disneylands, but for some people who does not want to spend their times in Disneyland (just like me), this place is great. I came to this place in June, when it was 32degrees celsius in HK. If I have to spend my whole day in Disneyland under the crazy sun of HK, I don't think I would make it. Lol. So it might be a good idea not to have a bigger area of Disneyland in 2 seasonal countries such as HK. Furthermore, you still can have all of the favourite rides and attractions.

There is 2 halal certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer's Club for muslim travellers. Do look out for the parades as kids will love it. Wear comfortable outfit and shoes if possible as the place is damn huge and require lots of walking. Highly recommended for all ages."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"624183786,2,2018-10,Australia,""When it comes to Disney, you expect wonderful things, but we were very disappointed with our overall experience here on our recent visit. The park is very small and doesn't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesn't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim. I wouldn't recommend visiting this theme park. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
624135894,3,2018-9,United Arab Emirates,Visiting Disneyland is dream for Kids & adults as well. We visited earlier in Paris but first time for my boy. The Disney train is really really lovely. Unfortunately during our visit the Main castle was closed for renovation & many other rides were closed due to Typhoon hence had limited choice. Even in evening the fireworks was cancelled & replaced with Parade which was good.Too small compare to the one in Paris with two attractions Disney Park & Studio but still good.Suggest to book ticket in advance preferable online at discounted price.,Disneyland_HongKong

Nice touch!Park   not the biggest of a Disney parks, one main ride per area plus some smaller ones. The castle is quite small (and at Oct 18 was undergoing maintenance and boarded up which was a shame). Some rides we hadn   t been on at other Disney parks.   The haunted mansion was actually quite good.

Better not to choose October or Chinese New Year as it will be crowded to serve the huge Chinese visitors."",Disneyland_HongKong"
623581485,4,2018-9,United Kingdom,All you would expect from a Disney site. The queues were short on the day which meant that we saw  rode most attractions in one day.

"623356811,5,2018-9,Australia,""We took our 1 year old to visit Hong Kong Disneyland as a birthday treat. We went the day after the clean up from the typhoon   I was very impressed with their efficiency! We had a fabulous time. The baby had fun on  it's a small world after all  boat ride, the  Winnie the Pooh  train ride and the  Incredibles  ride. It was easy to get around with a stroller (compared to the rest of HK which isn't stroller friendly), had decent food options for babies at the cafe, decent baby change and breastfeeding facilities were available and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't as large as the other Disneylands so it was easier to see all the entertainment. As we were leaving for the night, they put on a special Halloween parade. It is easy to get to HK Disneyland via the metro but you do need to change at least once on the metro if your hotel is on another HK island e.g. Kowloon. It is also close to the cable car ride at Ngong Ping so if there is time and energy, I would recommend doing the two together on the day. See Ngong Ping first and take the cable car for a great view of the beauty of HK and then take the metro to Disneyland and enjoy the rest of the day and evening there."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"623339896,5,2018-9,South Korea,""Smaller than the original Disneyland in Anaheim, but even with its compact nature it packs a day full of fun. We got super lucky on our day, it wasn   t so crowded so my friends and I managed to do every single thing, except the little kids rides. There are a few unique rides and HKD, like mystic manor and the new iron man ride, which will give you bragging rights as they aren   t at other parks, but then standards like a Star Wars version of space mountain, it   s a small world, and my personal favorite the jungle cruise. As to shows, go see them all. They were so much fun and amazing. Even some shows are in multiple languages at once, it only adds to the charm. Lion King was my favorite. And the parades, especially the Villains parade at night was really fantastic. The food was also good and not unreasonable considering HK prices. And if you want special stickers be sure to ask cat members for help or questions and then you may get one. I got three. Over all amazing fun day. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"623063730,5,2018-9,Australia,""Just like any other wonderful and enchanting Disneyland parks, facilities perfectly kept, high quality service and entertainment, we visit a week after one of the biggest typhoon ever hit the area, and besides the amount of trees they lost or got damaged everything else was up and running, with the exception of some areas around the castle that was close for repairs or improvements. Food was great, very large serves, food vouchers with our entrance tickets were a good option and even if you choose a meal over the limit of the voucher value, you can paid the difference. The park itself might be smaller than most of the other parks around the world, but still you have all of the favorite rides and areas, we loved every minute of it. One of the highlights for us, was the amazing Lion King show. Lots of characters around the park, 4 great parades every day. Great family experience. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
622786289,4,2018-10,Australia,We loved the experience and thought the rides were excellent. We stayed at Hotel Disneyland which I would highly recommend.Try to come in winter as the heat was almost unbearable during the middle of the day especially with 45 min queues due to Golden Week. It would be wonderful to see the park open until 10 or 11pm so that the rides could be enjoyed outside of the heat. We didn   t want to leave at 8pm!,Disneyland_HongKong
"622773202,2,2018-10,Australia,""When we planned our trip to Hong Kong we didn't realise that we would be there for the Mid Autumn Festival. When we went to Disneyland on the Sunday before the Festival we didn't realise that the line to get into the park would be over an hour long at 10am. The heat was oppressive and there was far too little shade and water dispensers available. After waiting, waiting and waiting we gave up by 3pm (after only getting in at 11am!) and left.The park is very small compared to other Disneyland's but the crowds at the bag check at the entrance were like I have never, ever seen before. Crazy!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"622768816,5,2018-10,New Zealand,""Hong Kong Disneyland was the third Disney experience for my fianc  e and me after LA and Paris.It   s smaller than the other Disneylands, and could probably be done in one day, but we opted to pay the tiny bit more for a second day, and ended up very pleased with that decision as we felt we got a lot of payback out of doing rides multiple times. Hong Kong Disneyland seem really good at making the rides effective even if you   ve done them a lot before. Mystic Manor is probably the best example, the details and special effects are incredible, we were noticing new things the fifth time we did it.The Jungle Cruise is also great   we did it four times   with the guides genuinely funny and a great action packed circuit. One of the zebras was missing an ear though.It is the least impressive Space Mountain we have seen yet but still worth doing a few times. The cheap Star Wars overlay does not work, and you can see too much of the track and rigging inside   it really should be blacked out, I thought that was the point.We highly recommend the Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars, we really like it how they did it in their own style rather than just mimic Big Thunder Mountain.Generally the crowds are well behaved with very little queue jumping.We were there on a Thursday and Friday   the park got really busy in the afternoon so I would recommend doing the big attractions in the morning or at the end   in the last hour we were able to walk on to It   s a small world, Jungle cruise, and Grizzly Mine carts without any queue.I would also suggest doing Fantasyland as soon as the park opens   we did five rides in the first hour, which would have been impossible later in the day.The teacups here are the fastest we have experienced and the rides are overall fairly gentle on the head and neck but still a lot of fun. We didn   t really like the Disneyland Railroad (not much to see   this seems pointless outside of LA) and the Iron Man simulator, which looked suspiciously similar to Star Tours.Throughout Disneyland, the cast are not as exuberant as in LA and generally don   t add to the experience, apart from on the Jungle Cruise. But they are helpful and polite and most seem to speak enough English for us to not have to worry. The only time where our our experience was marred by our lack of any Chinese language was the seasonal walkthrough based on the Nightmare before Christmas. There were 5 or 6 sections, all but one were entirely delivered by characters speaking Chinese only, so we were not really able to follow it. Visually it was very impressive but they should have warned guests that they would not understand it if they didn   t speak Chinese because this was the only thing in the park not with no English and it had one of the biggest wait times.I would recommend that Disney seriously considers restricting people from using big sun umbrellas. The Fairy Tale Forest was pointless because people just stand with their umbrellas blocking everyone   s view.Overall the park is probably not as aesthetically impressive as LA or Paris but it still feels very Disney. One area where they excel is how they light up the park at night   it looks great.So going in we though it might not have the genuine Disney feel due to it being very small, but this turned out to not be a problem at all. We also noticed far less annoying stroller parking everywhere than in LA and far less smoking than in France. The food had very good Disney theming. We got our Disney fix and we would recommend it."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Both my dad and I had the laksa which was at high quality ! My kids were having the hainan chicken , they enjoyed it a lot ! We got the pass to get into the Halloween town which was quite fun! Again may be too scary for young kids as my son cried after visiting The fantasy land is very suitable for young kids .

"621997514,4,2018-10,Canada,""My partner and I love Disney so we were always going to go to Disneyland Hong Kong when we saw there was one. In the last few years, we have checked out LA and Paris versions together. The park was great, alot better than expected and a nice size, meaning you could get around all the attractions if you spent the whole day there. The rides were longer than some of the other parks we have visited recently. Our only drawback, came from the shows on offer. The Lion King show was a spectacle to watch, with it being all singing and dancing, however, the songs didn   t sound the same, with varying notes used by the performers. We also went to the Moana show, expecting to see and hear some of the great music, but this time there was no music at all involved. Maybe it is hard to find performers at the right ability, but it is a slight area of improvement, if I was being picky. Overall, it was a great day out and I would highly recommend it, Tip   It   s obviously very hot, so make sure you take lots of water with you, as it   s fairly expensive in the park. Tip   We went on a Tuesday, hoping it would be quiet but was very busy, possibly as it was the day after China Day, so try go on a slower day to get around everything. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"621719662,5,2018-9,India,""Luckily i had kept Disneyland stay for the end of my family trip. The moment one enters the sprawling premises, one realises that only an American venture can be so elaborate, high tech & beautiful. With nothing much to do for a family visiting Hong Kong (in terms of activities involving kids), Disneyland more than made up for it. Built like a fairy  fantasy land with separate sections, one ideally needs 2 full days to be able to enjoy everything. Crowded like mad, there are long queues even for getting snaps clicked with disney characters all over. The 3 parades in a day were a spectacle to watch esp the end of the day as it was Halloween Theme in place. However, my son was hugely disappointed as he totally missed out on doing  Adventure Land  & still regrets it. Fault wasnt ours as we spaced out everything well after finding out shut down time from staff  site who told us it was 2000h. however, when we reached Adventure Land at about 1915h with 45mins to spare, it had totally shut down & nobody could explain as to why as all other sections were still open. Also, we had lost about an hour in the morning view heavy rains. But the authorities wouldnt allow us even limited entry of an hour into the Adventure Land the next day. that i personally feel was highly unprofessional & insensitive as THEY had shut down the section way before closing time. My son still feels miserable when he talks about the trip. So ideally, stay inside for 2 nights   just the right amount of stay. Its worth every penny"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too.

I was running and lowkey screaming when we got to the entrance arch. HAHA. A whole day is required to enjoy all the rides. We went there a little over lunch and we missed some. Lines were already forgiving during our trip since we went there on a Saturday in September, not a popular time to visit since blogs say it's already starting to rain in HK during September. Luckily, it was sunny during that time. And we only waited in line for an average of 10 minutes, I guess. Lucky, right?? Food will cost you a lot so it's better to eat outside and come with a full stomach. But if it cannot be avoided, there are food stalls inside. The sausages at Toy Story Land were good. !!!!DO NOT MISS THE HYPERSPACE MOUNTAIN RIDE AT TOMORROWLAND!!!! SO INTENSE!!!! The Small World ride was very cute and chill and relaxing, you should try that too. Since January 2018, there were no more fireworks display to close the day. To compensate, they do character parades three times a day. Because of this, we were not able to take photos with the characters (we prioritized the rides hehe) since no longer entertain photo ops at 5 PM, because the staff will be getting ready for the closing parade.

"620389712,3,2017-11,India,""Its famous attraction of hong kong probably because of its brand. However, I didn't find any extra ordinary ride s or show s in this theme park. I would rather suggest spend one extra day in Ocean park."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"620352169,5,2018-9,Hong Kong,""Everything is just so magical from start to finish. We took our daughter to Hong Kong Disneyland for her 5th Birthday. She carried a big smile on her face throughout the day. We took our car and it costed us HKD 220 for whole day. Tickets are expensive but worth paying. All shows were good but personally i enjoyed watching festival of the lion king   musical stage show re telling the story of Simba (Hakunama Tata). Waiting time for each ride is around 10 15 minutes (weekends). See if there is a FASTPASS distribution sign near the entrance of the attraction you want to ride. Cartoon characters too have resting time therefore, there's a possibility of missing out on few. Night parade is Spectacular.Quick Tip: At the time of heavy rain you may visit the nearest Disney shop and buy a raincoat worth HKD 60. Available for both adult and child and walk freely in Disneyland"",Disneyland_HongKong"
620201737,4,2018-9,Taiwan,Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing. We took the MTR from Kowloon to HK Disneyland and the trains are adorable. The Mickey Mouse windows and then the various statues of Disney characters were so fun to see. We arrived before the park opened and got to watch a family open the park. This family the mom was cutely dressed and the kids were in different Halloween costumes and they were picked to open up Disney. It was SO adorable. Right now Disneyland is decorated all for Halloween and there is an area for the Villians to be out and planning. The music is a variety of Halloween music. Mickey and Minnie mouse were dressed for Halloween. Here is my opinion....HK Disneyland is a great place to go. If you want to go on the rides as long as you are going during a peak time (which I'm not sure when that would be    we went during the Moon Festival) but for most rides we waited no more than 20 minutes. However meeting the characters could ranges from waiting for 5 minutes or you could be waiting for over an 1 hour. Food    if you are okay with not air conditioner you could grab your food and eat outside on the tables outside the restaurant.,Disneyland_HongKong

Love this place "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"619876833,4,2018-4,Australia,""Travel by train is easiest and cutest way to get to Disneyland as the train carriages and railway station are really worth seeing. We purchased entry tickets, available just for the day, from our hotel concierge. There is a lot of fairly flat walking to do and we started with the train within Disneyland to orientate ourselves. Ensure you have a hat and sunscreen in warm weather. Of course it is immaculately clean in every aspect.

And then we used our express pass given complimentary by Disneyland Hotel for all the fun rides and attractions, highly recommend space mountain because anything that is airconditioned and fast never fails to disappoint. After we've finished our priority passes we bought some slushies and popcorns to snack on and walked around to take polaroids with the characters around. Would recommend the trip for family and groups of friends. I've also heard that this is a rather small Disneyland compared to the ones elsewhere so I would recommend visiting this first :)"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Highly recommend the Iron Man Activity. The castle was closed due to remodeling I believe. We were able to get 1 picture with Star Wars characters, which was nice. Didn't see any other characters walking around except for the Halloween characters and Mickey once they started playing the Mickey song in the street. A lot of people but maybe because they have holiday now. Recommend the jungle ride.Thumbs up! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"619461372,4,2018-7,United States,""This may be the most beautiful of the Disneylands I've visited (LA, Orlando, Shanghai and Hong Kong) but it has the least to offer of them. We stayed and I recommend staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and were given paper FASTPASSes we could use on Ironman Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, and Mickey's PhilharMagic (which we didn't see as we have seen it numerous times in WDW). You get a certain number of FP for each person per night you stay based on your level of room. We stayed in a Kingdom Club Room and received 4 passes per night per person so we had 16 passes as we stayed four nights for 5 attractions. I threw some away and gave some away because it was simply too many for such a small park to even want to ride those same five attractions that many times! But I highly recommend this for at least one night. Staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel also gets you into Mickey and the Wondrous Book's first show in first which we did. We were still able to get a FASTPASS for Winnie the Pooh in the park as well and used a VIP tour to do all the rest of the rides skipping the line and for a private viewing area of the nighttime parade (which we didn't need as it wasn't crowded compared to US park standards even in July and we watched the parade from the upstairs of the RR station on Main Street with no one around us and a superb view). We were able to ride things multiples times and see all shows we don't have in our American parks. We had a great time but there is far less to do here and it does not require more than a day if you plan correctly. They don't have a lot of newer amazing attractions like Shanghai did and it was extremely hot in July so I'm only giving it four stars."",Disneyland_HongKong"

They recovered from the typhoon rather quickly. Most everything was open and you would never know the typhoon passed through here. The Ironman Experience is cheesy. It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly. It was funny to see one of the drummers with a body suit to make him look tanned with Maori tattoos.The parade had the normal characters Toy Story, Lilo & Stitch, etc. Seemed shorter than the American version.Overall, this little Disney is entertaining for the children and maybe teenagers. We spent a total of 3 hours there."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Disneyland wrote the book, created the genre and remain on TOP. We have visited the Hong Kong park multiple times and it never disappoints. The standards only ever improve. The cast are attentive and in character, the facilities are world class and the rides continually met Disney   s high standards. Our kids always love it, and as they get older, find new aspects of the park to love. Grisly gulch and mystic manor have climbed to the TOP of their list as favourite rides, and Groot is the new favourite character.

We enjoyed Disneyland but found lots of areas were closed because of the weather. There were not many places to eat at, I think most people grabbed tables to get shelter out of the weather. That made it difficult for anyone wanting to eat a meal at a table. It was quite easy to get on the rides as most people disappeared when the rain set in.

But for a Disney fans like me who have been to almost all Disneylands in the world except the one in Paris and Shanghai, I think the HK Disneyland is small but good enough for many people who have never been to Disneyland. One of the good things about the HK Disneyland is that you don   t have to walk a long way to get to each attraction as the park is not big. Compared to those in other cities such as the Disneyworld in Florida, for a slow walker like me, it   s pretty tiring to walk to each attraction, though there are some means of transport that I could use, for example the bus.And because it   s small, visitors can easily explore the whole park in just one day, giving them more time to see other beautiful places in HK.And for those visitors who like Chinese food, don   t forget to try the Plaza Inn, delicious chicken and suckling pig.

Unfortunately, the day when we went there, it was raining so we have to buy raincoats. Raincoats cost 70HKD. But the rain did not stop us from enjoying what Disneyland has to offer. I could say that one day is not enough to try all the rides and attractions that this park has. But the best part for me are the shows we watched   Feast of the Lion King, Mickey's Philharmonic Theater and Storybook. It was like going back to my childhood days. So nostalgic, specially for a Disney fan like me. The parade was the main highlight for me which I totally enjoyed. One of the things I was disappointed about is that there were no fireworks because Sleeping Beauty castle was closed for renovation. I also did not get to see as much Disney characters, maybe because it was raining? Lastly, the food is pricey and in small portions too.

The park was closed during our stay for one day and many things in the park were not running or closed. All we asked was to be able to use our passes on Saturday to make up for the closed day and the other problems as we leave Sunday.He gave us the magical template answer with a NO, passes cant be used on Saturday with no consideration.

It would have meant that we could spend more time at Disneyland and get to stay for the fireworks at night. We went on a relatively quiet day, but the lines were still too long to bother getting photos with the characters that made random appearances throughout the day. Lines were good for the rides that were age appropriate for our 2 year old and we still managed to spend the whole day there, but not see everything. If we had another opportunity to go back, we would invest the few extra dollars to stay at the Disneyland hotel and therefore spend more time there. Cost is to be expected going to a theme park, and they had a lot of Chinese food available for lunch. Either that or expensive Mickey Mouse shaped waffles.

There are not that many rides here, and it's probably something you can do in 1 2 days at a leisurely pace, especially if it's not busy (there weren't any rides that had longer than 15 minutes wait when we went on a weekday).There are some unique features of this park  Mystic Manor, and some characters who we have never met before, like Cookie (friend of Duffy). Lilo is also here.The food here is expensive, and there is less variety than the US. No dedicated ice cream store, only one churro cart, etc..With little crowds, this was quite a good experience for us. The castle is small, but they're upgrading.

614741477,5,2018-4,Singapore,A good place for adult and children. Had a good fun time roaming around Disneyland and taking rides. To my muslim friends.... there is a halal foodcourt in the theme park. I advise to buy your tickets online and they might have a good  promotion.,Disneyland_HongKong
614501249,5,2018-6,Australia,Not as large at other Disneyland properties but still the happiest place on earth.  Be aware that many rides when standing in queue don't have shade so can be very hot.   Not so many rides for entertainment.,Disneyland_HongKong

We went on a Monday off peak. Most rides had a five minutes queue. I will pull recommend this park for parents who hate rollercoasters, have young kids who want to go to Disneyland and can't go on rides on their own. The rides in this park is really mild but your kids will get all the experience of being in Disneyland. My daughter really really enjoyed it even though it wasn't as thrilling as the others."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Think 12 was just too old. There were a few bigger rides that we went on that were very good,but not many. Long queues for everything and mostly family rides that very little kids could go on so not very thrilling. Very expensive day out. Took an hour to get there, went on 4 rides in 31 2 hours and left.

It's a small park and doesn't have a lot of rides but we enjoyed our day there. The most beautiful part was Adventure land which was large with amazing trees and landscaping. There are only 3 FastPass rides: Winnie the Pooh, Hyperspace Mountain, and IronMan. The Grizzly ride was probably our favorite. Definitely go early because most people seem to come around 2:00.

The fireworks part was the best fireworks I have ever seen.

I am so looking forward to visit Disneyland again."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"612301758,3,2018-8,United Kingdom,""As part of our trip to Hong Kong, Disneyland was definitely a must do. Having visited other Disneyland   s in the past, this one full filled some of our expectations, but not all.The arrival was easy, as well as entertaining. With special Disney MTR trains, a manicured Station, a grand sign leading up to the park, and a fountain with Mickey surfing above Moby Dick with all his friends watching.We walked straight to the gate queues having bought our tickets (from Klook) and printed them of as instructed. Unfortunately not everyone had done so, and there was chaos as people tried to find get their QR codes to work from their phones as they held up the every increasing line. The park opened at 10am, but no rides were open until 10.30. Even then not all. Sleeping Beauty   s Castle is under refurbishment, so can   t be seen properly or accessed. We rode and enjoyed The Iron Man experience which was a simulation ride, after getting fast passes for Space Mountain. The Jungle Cruise was ok, with queues for the 3 different languages. Don   t be fooled by the short English queue. After riding Space Mountain, we watched the Jedi Training. They catered well again for the different languages using them all. The kids were great.Unfortunately after that the heavens opened, and it poured with rain. There didn   t appear to be enough places for people to shelter, in regards to indoor rides or covered areas. Big puddles everywhere. However the silver lining was they did open Mystic Manor which was closed for the day.Overall not loads of rides, but lots of character meeting areas (with queues of course). Need to be a bit more organised?"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"612212885,3,2018-8,India,""The rides are great as Disney   s quality and It is not too crowded so there is no long wait time. However, cast members are below par.

We wanted to watch Mickey and the wondrous book, for two sessions we missed the opportunity. The staff told us that if we wait there 45 minutes before the session, we can definitely get into the 1000 seats. So going there last minute doesn   t help.We have priority pass for Festive of the lion king, moreover unless you are there 30 min before, the pass will not be helpful.At heavy rain times, most rides continue, it might worth getting a rain coat and keep going.We had priority admission for the Iron Man experience, but it is expected to be 102cm for this."",Disneyland_HongKong"
611892744,4,2018-8,United Arab Emirates,I strongly advise people to take the 2 day pass if with kids. mostly all rides have long waiting hours even on weekdays. if you are staying at any of Disneys hotel you will also get a fast pass for every night so dont miss this opportunity ,Disneyland_HongKong
"611613195,4,2018-7,United Kingdom,""Hong Kong Disneyland it is fun. We went there without kids, but yet being an adult you will surely enjoy the experience. The negative side, the queuing and the excesive cost of food and drinks inside the park. However, worths the visit."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"611506887,4,2017-11,India,""This theme park suits the kids very well. However, I was clueless as to why this park had a 2 days pass that sells. It can be completed well within 1 day as I feel that unless you will feel obligated to visit each n every attraction, there is no need to spend 2 days here. Otherwise, the place is beautiful, food is great, costly of course. The 4D effect in theatre experience of Iron Man was well created. But the post sunset fireworks were an absolute visual delight and you need to stay back till 7:30 pm to make your visit feel complete. Easy to commute to Disneyland by MTR: East Tsim Sha Tsui         Nam Cheong         Sunny Bay         Disneyland.

You don't have to walk as far to get where you are going. The lines or rides are much shorter than the other Disneylands I have been too. My only complaint is that it was so hot there that I sweated so much it made my shorts look as if I had wet myself. On that nite I would advise you all to visit there during the winter. The staff there was helpful at all times. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

The night parade was cancelled at the 11th hour due to thunderstorm which was a shame. The ticket prices were reasonably priced but food, drinks and balloons etc were extortionate prices. A balloon was $150 which I thought was ridiculous. Queues were reasonable for rides. The most we queued was 40 minutes for the rollercoaster. All others were under 30 minutes. Using the app was helpful to see queue times."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Best Things:1. Rides and attractions are great, as are shows like Lion King. 2. Everything is clean and well maintained.3. Its so easy to get to and from with the MTR (train) or taxisWorst Things:1. Food is very expensive and wait times can be very long (eg 30  minutes for McDonalds!) for pretty basic fare. 2. Wait times for photos with Disney characters are very long, some active 'people management' should be employed to make it 15 seconds per photo opportunity then move on! 3.

I almost fainted of heat. Good thing I brought an extra blouse. They have great restaurants around. We tried this Chinese Restaurant that offers very big bowl of noodle soup. It's good for 2 persons I guess. But we ordered one each. So we did not finish it. The rides are just very... cute. Really for kids. No life threatening rides which some people enjoy.

For some reason the Jungle Cruise line was longer than any other I waited for! Lucky for me they had a line for English speaking and the    river guide    spoke in clear English. Which is more than could be said for the train conductor whose English was indistinguishable from her Chinese. The castle was under construction but I was informed of that before I paid.

It is a smaller version of the Eurododney and the original Disneyland in the US.The Hong kong Disneyland specializes in shows which is a fantastic add on to the park usual stuff. I found this place very enjoyable and much better for the parents because you can catch up almost everything in less than a day. Very recommend!!,Disneyland_HongKong
607862846,5,2017-9,Australia,By far the smallest Disney. Easy enough to get most done in 1 day. Went during week so not so many kids. Has all the classic Disney features but on a smaller scale.,Disneyland_HongKong
"607732296,4,2018-4,Sweden,""Travelled earlier this year in April.Very smooth getting to Hong Kong Disney by the MTR. Traveling with 3 young kids was fairly easy and smooth.Having visited most of the Disney parks we had quite high expectations for this park, and they were met. As soon as you board the Disney train from sunny bay station you can see and feel that there was no expenses spared. We visited on a Saturday and it was busy but not overcrowded.At the time not all the rides open and there were a few parts under construction or renovation including the main castle.Average wait time for the characters was about 1hr. Average queue time for kids rides was about 30mins.We opted for the 3 in 1 meal pass which worked out best for us.Our lunch meal was at royal banquet hall which was surprisingly very good, considering it was theme park food. And dinner was at Clopin's Festival of Foods, and this was amazing! Coming from Stockholm, I have to admit that the food we got from this restaurant was better than anything I   ve had in sweden.

Too tasty and the smell is divine.,Disneyland_HongKong
"606844266,5,2018-7,United States,""Definitely the smallest of all the Disney theme parks world wide, but it stores a really strong punch of Disney Magic! I visited during the 13th anniversary of the theme park. They are going through major renovations in 2018 and are slated to build a brand new castle! Perhaps by 2021 it will be completed! I've been to all the Disney theme parks and I must say this definitely takes the Chinese culture and melds it in with the traditional Disney experience. They offer grilled squid as a snack! Toy Story Land is a definitely Must See... YOU MUST go on the Mystic Manor ride! It's so much fun and offers a different vision of the Haunted Mansion ride! Another ride you must do is the Iron Man Experience which is similar to Disneyland's Star Tour's ride, except it takes you to Stark Expo where Hydra starts causing mayhem and Tony Stark saves the day!

Who doesn't love the idea of water   dance   party under the sun? LOL. I believe this is a special for summer only. Hope to go again before it ends.Ah btw, they also added Zootopia meet & greet. Another must do!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Not sure if the staff was train to put on such arrogant attitude or what, if this is the case, then good job Disneyland HongKong, you have pissed off and turned off 1 of the many tourist.Will never ever visit this horrible place again."",Disneyland_HongKong"
606117019,3,2018-8,Colombia,The park has some unique attractions that are not in other Disney parks. The staff is rude and never smile. There's not fireworks show.  The parade and the mapping at night is amazing.  The Iron Man atraction is great.,Disneyland_HongKong
"606070688,2,2018-7,United States,""So many things were missing from this park. The castle is so small it is embarrassing and I did not find the American experience translated well. Food prices are obscene   $5 for a bottle of water   so bring your own water if nothing else. There are water fountains but the water is burning hot   really   and I was hesitant to drink it. Mystic Point was a great addition to the park as was Hyperspace Mountain. Strange hours   opening at 10 and closing at 9pm. Also, the train stopped at 6pm which was super disappointing! Why?? Really overall it seemed like a money grab and while the day was enjoyable, as someone in our party (who is a HUGE Disney fan) commented, the place  Is missing the magic . And I agree. Not a bad amusement park   the rides were fun   but the prices... .OUCH! Easy to get to though and the train there is fantastic.

The different shows are a must see so check the schedules. The parade at night is so amazing and beautiful. The down side when we visited was that the castle was under construction so didn't have that show and get to see the castle or all the princess but what a wonderful day. I would recommend using the MTR and Disney Train for an additional experience instead of the bus..You have to do more than 1 day in order to see all the areas or experience the rides, its a long long day and the parks are expensive so make sure you budget for it but its definitely a must to do and see!

Not many rides for our son , in fact not many rides in the park we were expecting slightly more. The prices for food obviously high, water included.

Lots of new and current characters abound but the land area hasn't increased to accommodate the extra additions. Many of the old favorites were missing this time   or perhaps they are no longer there! There does not appear to be any  Crowd control  they just kept arriving and being allowed entry   surely there is, or should be, a maximum limit! The most famous structure, well, Disney one that it, is the Castle. Once you could walk thru, into or around but not on my day. The lower 40% or so was covered up. A pic of the upper portion was still quite good and would give the littlies a thrill. Refreshments etc quite fairly priced."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We spent around 7 hours there just couldn't hang out until the light show but the parade during the day was fantastic so don't miss it we went on rides and watched both a 3 D film show and a stage show that were both great and gave us a bit of a break out of the heat seating down in the air conditioned theatres on top of that there there are plenty of drink and food outlets scattered around the park together with your Disney souvenirs and they are not that expensive compared to what your use to paying in Australia."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The cost is expensive for what's here priced at $124 new zealand. Due to the heat it would be better to visit from 2pm until closing as this would give you time to enjoy the park and see the parades. Do take your own food and drink as food here is expensive. The waiting time for most rides can be up to an hour but you might get lucky. Get a fast past to avoid the lines.

Tip: buy tickets in advance at klook or kkday as it will save your time queueing. Be there weekdays as tourists flock during weekends. We were so happy the weather was so good! Initially we checked the weather one week before and it states that thunderstorms will occur but it turned out sunny! We were able to enjoy almost all the rides, almost but not all. There are still some live shows but I am not really a fan of it. For me, one day is enough as HK's disney is smaller compared to HK Shanghai and Paris, accordingly. If you're visiting during summer, bring gear up comfortable outfits as it is really hot, and wear rubber shoes as it really involves a lot of walking. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

It was an amazing sight seeing the park contrasted against the green mountains. There are loads of rides and shows to fill 1 2 days. However there aren't very many shops in main street USA. Still enough to get your Disney goods.Toy story land was roughly the same size as Paris. Their 'big thunder mountain' ride was a high lite. One of the best rides I have ever been on in Disney park. We all came off in fits of laughter and were so unprepared for all the twists and surprises.We could see there were more marvel rides being built so the park is expanding.There aren't as many restaurants as the other parks however there is a fair amount of variety.

"598809669,5,2018-7,Canada,""A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy! "",Disneyland_HongKong"

Others were mostly routine stuff.Easy to navigate (though a bit hot   in June)Staff were very friendly , everything was well organised. The place is well maintained. Lot of greenery.As expected, food is costly (outside food is not allowed, bags are checked at the entrance).Wifi (free) is not very good, didn't find their app very useful.The night parade was fantastic and worth the wait.We took a two day pass (is only marginally more expensive than one day ticket)Better to go early (and of course avoid holidays and weekends). Still you might find some school trips which will add to the waiting time.Can be easily accessed by MTR, but we preferred to stay in the nearby Disney hotel (regular free shuttle buses are available)"",Disneyland_HongKong"

I expected that the queues would be very long to every ride and every photo op with the characters. It was indeed. We enjoyed the parades the most. Anyway, on the second day, when i hit the star wars shop, I lost my wallet. I was so pissed when i was told that there was no CCTV in the shop. I couldn't just believe it. But since I don't want our days ruined, I asked help from the outside and still continued the journey until we got rescued by a friend of friend who lent us money for train fare and food. At 4PM though, I got an email from Disney that said that it could be my wallet that has been recovered so I ran to the lost and found area, left my daughter who was on queue to Cinderella Op to two nice local girls and voila, recovered my wallet which was intact by the way. With the many beautiful things that happened in between, someone unknown lent us money, two girls promised to take photos of my daughter with Cinderella in case I don't come back right away, a lady gave me discount coupons for items I want to buy and so on...I paid back good deeds by paying their items and food.

"598047828,5,2018-7,United Arab Emirates,""This was my first time at a Disney park and even though this park is midway through a transformation, it   s worth going for the fantastic rides such as Mystic Manor, one of the best dark rides I   ve ever experienced, truly a sight to behold.

"597512353,3,2018-7,United States,""My 4 year old had fun here but the long lines were a little too much for him. There is a lot to do here. When you factor in the lines, I don   t think anyone can go through the whole park in one day. We saw maybe a third of it. We were at Disneyland for about 6 hours.The food here is highly overpriced. The shops were crowded, but nice for AC. The bathrooms were a bit dirty. The toilets are on the ground (which is good for boys).There were a lot of rude tourists (adults and kids) who appear to be in a rush and were pushing a lot.Overall, it was worth visiting once. I may or may not go back when my son is older, more patient, and can protect himself from the tourists who push. FYI: I asked them at the gate.... If I buy a one day ticket and my son loves it, could I upgrade to the two day ticket and pay the difference before I leave? The answer was no."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"597492921,4,2018-7,Australia,""I've been to most of the Disney parks and this one is by far and way the smallest of them. It's quite easy to do most of the park in the morning if you get their early, after an 1.5hr we had done most of the main rides. Entry seems to be a very muddled affair with none of the gates moving fast, however when you are in everything works well.They open the different lands at different times which seems very strange. The Mystic Manor is definitely well worth going into.The park has the magic of the Disney parks and is well worth going to. I really am at a loss why you would need 2 days there, but I guess if you have small children it takes a longer to get from place to place.Plenty of different food options to choose from with a good mix of Asian and Western to choose from (prices are Hong Kong Prices so expensive).The parades get very crowded so well worth picking a good spot in the shade before it starts."",Disneyland_HongKong"
597191526,5,2018-7,Netherlands,We had a great day at the Disneyland. From the centre of hong Kong island it   s about 45 min with the MTR. The last train is in Disney style to a real Disney station.

We get a new one for free. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"596871568,4,2018-7,United States,""Pretty small and manageable  you can easily hit all the highlights within the first three or four hours of the park opening (assuming you go at line drop and don't stop for breakfast character meets etc). The park has a lot of repackaged rides areas from Disneyworld and Anaheim Disneyland, which was fine but nothing new. The best rides that are relatively novel to Hong Kong are Iron Man and Mystic Manor (the best, obviously). My favorite part of the whole park was actually the shows, which were really well done and blended Cantonese and English in a very accessible and interesting way. Definitely try to catch the Jedi Training  it was hilarious and great. The shows were the most identifiably  Hong Kong  part of the park, so they were really memorable for me, as a westerner. If you need an afternoon beer, River View Cafe has one beer on tap."",Disneyland_HongKong"

596413118,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,I am a huge Disney fan and this was the last park that I had not visited. I absolutely loved it. The cast members are amazing and always willing to help. Hong Kong Disneyland has some really unique attractions. Mystic Manor needs to be seen to be believed. This is a lot of fun and no other Disney work has something like this. I had a lot of fun with various character interactions. The Paint the Night parade is a must see.,Disneyland_HongKong
"596359522,5,2018-7,United States,""We love all things Disney!!! So on our visit to Hong Kong I knew Disneyland would be a HAVE TO DO thing on our vacation. And it did not disappoint. The park is much smaller than its USA counterparts but it is still a great Disney experience. There were little to no lines, many of the rides were the same so I got to ride rides that I wouldn   t wait in line for in the USA. And there were many rides the US parks didn   t have. The characters were all awesome and interacted with everyone in our party. I would definitely say Hong Kong Disney is a must do attraction while in Hong Kong!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"596273767,4,2018-7,Indonesia,""The kids had been looking forward to visiting Hong Kong Disneyland but we visited on a very hot day. We had pre booked and arrived on the Disney Train and exchanged our voucher for the tickets. The walk to the attractions was quite long but the kids really enjoyed themselves on the various rides and of course with popcorn and ice creams.Queues were really long so we tried to stay indoors and visited places like  It's a small world , although that had a very long queue and involved a lot of waiting before we could get a ride.This is the second Disneyland we have visited but due to the immense crowds and the hot weather the kids did not enjoy it as much as Tokyo Disneyland. If we visit a Disneyland again we will check the weather and definitely not go on a public holiday or weekend.Overall, a nice visit, especially at the Main Street Corner Cafe which had nice drinks and decent food."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Food was expensive and quite good quality. The only issue I have is I wanted to get photo's with characters but didn't see one, which was disappointing, and we read the park brochure but there was very little information about where they were positioned during the day. I think you need more than one day, as we only had a short amount of time."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"595995373,5,2018-7,United States,""Absolutely worth going to even if you aren't a Disney fan. It was spotless, service was fantastic, rides were great, shows were enjoyable and definitely worth allowing one full day to visit. We went on almost all of the rides and saw all but one show and had dinner, watched the projection show and then the parade and it made for a full day. It was very enjoyable but very hot. Make sure you bring cash for purchases at small stands and remember there are ATM's if you need them. There isn't a lot of shade and in ToyStory land, not much shade. And it was hot!

It is definatley far less expensive than the other parks and less crowded. The staff seem to genuinely love their jobs as they all seem very happy. definately try and go mid week although we went Monday and Tuesday and whilst Monday was great with nearly no line ups. Tuesday was almost double the crowd size! Only  small  negative we thought was the limited food options.

Not bad if you are carrying a toddler as you need to park your stroller before entering the cueing area. Food prices are as expected, on the high side. If you want to skip long lines, opt for the sit down restaurants like Maxim   s. Great Chinese food. Actually, I have not tried the other dining outlets. During our previous visit years ago, we also chose to eat at Maxim   s. At least, it is consistently good. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"595276758,2,2018-7,Barbados,""Although I read the reviews prior to going, I still wasn't expecting the park to be that small. The first disappointment was the 'fake' train station building.

Main Street was less than 5th of the length than it's counterparts, and castle (although surrounding by hoarding), looked no higher than your tallest basketball player! Many of the food establishments were closed, although what i eat eat was very good.

I am SO glad we did. We arrived in the afternoon on a Friday and decided to get in a half day at the park. We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of a crowd. We immediately noticed the friendliness of the staff and the smiles which were not common in Shanghai. The staff gave stickers and really tried to help us in English when needed. The crowds were well behaved and I was not pushed once all day!!!! Even the parades and the projection show were fun, orderly and well managed by the staff. Shanghai Disneyland could learn a lot from Hong Kong. The park is small and the castle was closed which made it feel smaller but it was so clean and happy that we really enjoyed ourselves. The Royal Banquet Hall in FantasyLand made us vegetarian spaghetti with marinara sauce that was really good. We also went to the park on Saturday and it was still pleasant with an increased crowd."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The park was very clean and we were impressed by the food options offered, much better than the usual fayre (burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets etc). Mystic Manor was the highlight for us, a real gem. Space mountain is slow and disappointing compared to Paris, could do with updating. Mine train was a good surprise.

In summers do not forget to carry your hand fan as it gets very hot and humid. The toilets are available at every 5 10 minutes walk which are very neat and clean and are air conditioned so one can tae rest in the washroom. Outside every washroom, drinking water tap is available so carry your refillable water bottles. Do carry pram if you have a child. Prams are available for rent also. Do not miss the 7pm Mickey magic book show and the 8.30pm parade. The rides almost last not more than a minute. So cant enjoy rides much but the shows are all amazing."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"594776826,5,2018-6,Australia,""The youngest of our group was 7 and the oldest 57. Everyone had a great time. No extreme rides for thrill seekers, but fun just the same. We went in June so it was hot and humid. Pack water bottles, there are water filling stations everywhere. Go early and be there at opening as it gets really busy around midday. By mid afternoon the park was pumping with people. We went on a weekday so crowds were manageable. My tip would be to do Ironman and that section then hop over to Toyland if that   s on your list as it gets very very hot and crowded over there in the afternoon and there is limited shade. Wait times there were the longest at 30mins and in the heat we decided to bypass it. Food wasn   t as expensive as I expected. It   s not cheap though either, so have a good breakfast and if you choose something like a rice and curry for lunch it will fill you and keep you going until closing. Small snacks could have been taken in, but I think anything big would be confiscated. Don   t miss the Lion King show. I did and family who had seen the stage show and we   re unsure about going to it, said it was fantastic. I now regret not making the time to see it."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We went on a Friday and there was a crowd but we still managed to cover much of the park. I have been to Magic Kingdom Disney in Orlando and it took us 2 days. We felt satisfied with the HK Disney after one day because we had covered so much due to the lack of lines. The Lion King show was a highlight. The Moana show is a new feature but needs more seating as it was very crowded. Overall we had a great time and would recommend!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Still, they did a great job with the Disney here. We thoroughly enjoyed it. While it wasn't close to Disney World, it was close to being there. They did a nice job with Tomorrowland. The show we saw was incredibly inclusive. It performed the songs in English. The dialogue was in Cantonese with subtitles on either side in English and Mandarin. Prices were Disney prices. Everything was pretty expensive, but that is the way Disney is. The parade at the end of the night was a lot of fun. Exiting the park was incredibly easy with the MTR stop right there.

You get theme park map at the ticket window and also at kiosks just after entering the ticket chekpoints .Take a few minutes to note the show times , Parade and fireworks Parade and fireworks show is not to be missed .People usually take good spots along the parad route well before the parade start time .Most popular rides and shows have the fast pass system so you can tag yourbtiket at the fast pass kiosk at each of those rides and return at the punched time so you will get to go through the fast pass queue which is shorter .A great place for day out with family"",Disneyland_HongKong"

"591857578,3,2017-7,India,""The trip to HK Disneyland was a blend of good and bad experiences. Firstly it's a bit expensive travel to and fro in MTR form Hong Kong or Central station to Disneyland. The entry ticket pass is also expensive. The only recommendation I would give is if you have been to any other disneyland's in the world or especially paris, skip this one for sure. There's no need to waste your time, money and a whole day for this place. I have been to another 3 disney's including paris and I am telling you from my experience. It is seriously not worth it. If you have kids who are under 15 then you can surely opt a day out in disney but if you are traveling adults or teens like me in early 20's then it's a strict no. They don't have any thrilling rides for adults or teens. Though the whole idea behind creating a disney park is for children but they should keep in mind that children are not the only age group that visit. Besides it is so packed and flocked. The queues and waiting times are very long and lengthy. There's not much seating space with shade. The food and drinks in the disney are way too expensive. Not much choices for vegetarians. The Ocean Park is a very good alternative for Disneyland. You can choose Ocean Park over Disneyland on any given day and you surely won't regret it. Kids will surely love disneyland but not all age groups I am afraid. The evening lights in the park are very pretty. Hence we made a mistake and sacrificed a day which we could had utilized for a better purpose."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"591199364,3,2018-6,Hong Kong,""I hate to give Disney a bad review but I have not been to Hong Kong Disneyland in about four years and I was a bit disappointed today. It was just not quite    on pointe    and lacked some of that    Disney Magic   . Small things were out of place... for example some of the lights not working and the rain chains not lying correctly in the rain forest scene in    it   s a small world   , a maintenance man fixing a gate that was not even being used (with all his tools on the ground in front of him) in the line of    Ironman Experience    while visitors were walking by to ride and the majority of the non performing cast members looking like they hated their jobs   no smiles.We were looking forward to seeing the new Moana show but the venue is absolutely ridiculous. Only three rows of seats in an area that could accommodate a lot more and not much shade cover so unless you got the seats, you had to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes to watch. That made the entire show very unenjoyable and was a real downer. The kids hated it and said it was the worst part of their day. It   s seriously just seemed like Disney took the cheap route to create a new entertainment item.Also, we did not see it posted anywhere, not even on the Disneyland app, that they now close the rides in the back of the park one hour before closing time    We wasted time walking to the back of the park to ride some of those rides again and we would have changed our evening schedule had we known they would close early. We used to love riding the Mine Cars in the dark before the park closed.My sister was visiting us and is an avid Disney fan. She said,    No wonder no one comes to this Disneyland. The park is not open enough hours to get your money   s worth, they close some of the rides early and there is not a lot of shade cover compared to the other hot location, Walt Disney World in Florida.   I expect more from Disney. Thankfully, the new Light Parade is fantastic and so the day ended with that classic    Disney Magic   . "",Disneyland_HongKong"

Parade earlier used to be proper walk of Mickey, Donald but now they mainly use LED floats which are not that interesting. We faced thunderstorm on our visit so many rides got cancelled & we got wet.

Hong Kong disneyland is smaller in comparison to the other Disneyland but it is just as magical, with shows happening all around the park all day long and characters walking the streets. We had a suprise while attending shows when us Americans (being only english speakers) were greeted with bilingual shows! We found this quite entertaining. We went to this park in November so everything was decorated in a Christmas theme and they even had a Christmas parade and a wonderful (fake) Snowfall!!! My friends had been missing our snowy winter weather at home so this was a fantastic surprise when loads of snow was shot over the crowd with flashing Christmas lights and festive music.Would definitely recommend visiting the Hong Kong Disneyland to people of all ages as it is truly the happiest place on earth!

However, water at   3 a bottle was fairly steep.There was some renovation taking place at the laughably small castle which hampered some of the space in the park.Staff were all friendly and courteous throughout. An area for improvement would be the types of badge they give you in entry needing variety (other Disney parks have    just married   ,    Birthday    etc).Having been to an animation academy before at a different Disney, we were pleased that this was available here too. While the classes say they are only in Cantonese, don   t be put off as it   s easy to follow, great fun, and they do throw in a few English explanations along the way.Very easy to get there via HK metro   there   s a special Disney line which takes you the last part of the way.

We lined up for entrance and it moved pretty fast. We never needed to use a fastpass and we were able to ride everything we wanted to. The cast members were also very helpful and we just had a great time.

Choosed Hkg as this was the nearest in terms of flight time from KL, was worried he wouldnt take to kindly to being strapped down to his seat, going was stressful but coming home was easier as he slept throughout his flight. One thing i discovered was in order to take loads of pix with Mickey and gang, best place is to dine in one of theyre restaurants where makes they make scheduled appearances, taking photos with Disney characters in Disneyland itself entails a long queue. Staying in Disney hotels was also a treat. Travelling to and from Disneyland and even to the city was easy as they had frequent free coaches. Going a week before the holidays, and on a weekday, queues for the rides were fast and short. Be prepared to spend though as the Disney Resort Hotel, all day tickets, foods and gift shop items are not cheap. All in all it was an enjoyable experience and my kid had a blast hugging and kissing Mickey and gang, not to mention mummy and daddy had a jolly good time to.

A really pleasant surprise was on the 2nd day, the staff at the MTR told me the park may be closed due to the rains, while I bought the tickets. If you still decide to go, we did on both rainy days as we had a 2 day pass, take a rain coat  umbrella. Or pay HK $70 to buy one at the park.Lot of walking to do, plan your visit and what you want to do before you get there. This way you will finish off all that you want, before exhausting yourself and most importantly if you have kids. It can get really hot and humid!My little girl is a princess maniac and the experience of meeting Snow White, Elsa, Sophia, Tinker Bell, Moana was quite phenomenal. I loved the way the characters interact with kids making it a truly memorable experience. If you are looking for A particular character, make sure you check if they are on schedule the day you   re going. E.g. Elsa, we went on Tue and Fri and we could meet Elsa only on Fri. They have fixed timings, so planning will certainly help.The shows are good too, Lion King, Moana, etc. Plan 30 mins per show, minimum. The night parade is awesome, I see kids fascinated by the light show and characters.Food is good, lot of options available. If you have the 2 day pass, make sure you have the eTicket handy the 2nd day, even if you   ve registered with you finger print.Pretty easy to get there via MTR.We   ve been to the one in Paris, this one though smaller definitely packs a punch.

"589220822,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,""I had purchased my park tickets from a travel agent a few days prior, this meant less queuing at the park, it was also cheaper than buying direct, I got this in Tai Po but am sure most travel agents will be able to help.Arrived early Via a 2 buses from Sha Tin, the transport links are brilliant and well signed, We arrived before the park opened so near the front of the que and saw Mickey and Minnie greeting people before the gates officially opened. The park its self is smaller than the others I had visited (Paris and Orlando) but still plenty to do. Lion King Show was a highlight and we saw this twice. With the help of some good fortune Fast passes and single rider queues we managed to get on 11 rides see 2 shows one twice and meet 3 characters so if you plan your day well it   s easy to see a lot of the park in one day, which is not really possible is any of the others. The Space mountain now a Star Wars ride was really well themed, the Avengers part of the park was also very well done with the iron man ride a nice little attraction, but very similar to the Star Wars rides in other parks. The Mickey Mouse celebration projector show was first class and well worth the wait. Couple of Negatives for me, the Castle was closed which we knew about but obviously takes away the famous photo opportunity, also the iPhone app and the Website showed different times for the park closing which also meant it showed the wrong time for the parade, this left me sat on main street an hour longer than I had hopped.But overall a very enjoyable park with some very fun rides, it is most certainly is the happiest place on earth."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Second day ticket is a fraction of the cost of day one. Lines were 20 30 minutes on a Saturday unheard of at other Disney locations.Like the other Disney parks the castle and several other areas are being brought into the 21st century so expect some closures.

There are also some upgrades and renovations on some of the rides compared to the last round I came which is ten over years ago. Food prices are more reasonable with varieties though taste not very fantastic. Queues are quite long probably due to their public holidays and school holidays and quite a lot of their locals are in the park too. Just a note that there are no more fireworks and parade of the characters. Only lightning visuals displays. Toilets there are cleaner than before and it   s air conditioned. Most of the rides are indoors which is good as the summer period can be very hot like in Singapore. Cons:Not many complaints except for the long queuing time. Worth to visit again if there are new rides in future.,Disneyland_HongKong
"588779840,4,2018-5,Singapore,""It   s my 2nd time there in 3 years. This time round we found that some of the ride didn   t seem as good as before as they may have made some alterations. Example that it   s a small world ride used to keep repeating the song the last time but this time it   s just played once combined with the music. The other Pooh ride used to have a lot of pretty panels each time you turn into an area but now it seems the amount of panels has lessen and the ride shorten. Even the night parade cars are less gorgeous as the 1st time we saw it. But then we also discovered other rides we haven   t been able to ride on the first time we went. The new iron man experience was quite awesome! There   s also an iron man virtual reality game for my 2 yr old son at the store in the Tomorrowland which is quite fun while his parents went solo and used the fast passes for the main attractions. As for the other ride we tried as single rider while our son slept, it   s the toy soldier parachute drop. It   s not for young kids.. but teens shld be able to withstand the excitement and not break into tears. Also we think the mickey   s philharmagic at fantasyland is pretty awesome but then my son was a bit scare of it maybe due to the loud noise inside.. so really have to consider if bringing very young kids there. The only one ride that my son loves is the slinky dog spin at toy story land. As for the other ride that his parents enjoyed, it   s the mystic manor. As usual it   s not for very young kids as it   s quite dark in there and can be scary for them. My son is pretty cool with the dumbo ride and obitron which is pretty much the same type of ride. As for food, we think the best food court is at fantasyland and also mystic point. It   s good to go during weekdays as it   s less crowded and if there in summer, do 1 2 of the outdoor rides u wish to try before going indoors for the rest till later in the afternoon. This works really well for us as we try the dumbo and obitron ride first before going indoors for other rides like Pooh ride, mickey   s philarmagic, it   s a small world, Ironman and hyperspace mountain, till later in the day when it   s not so hot did we go to toy story area for the other rides there.

588642315,5,2018-4,Bahrain,Its a full day trip at the disneyland. This one isnt bigger like the US one but good enough to keep kids occupied for a day. Beautiful parade at the noon and closing time. And loads of free shows whose timings are posted and updated based on weather conditions. Tip : Can be very crowded for weekend and public holidays with 45 60 min waiting at each ride. Try going on tuesday wed and thurs. Less crowded. Also try cloudy and raininy days.,Disneyland_HongKong

The great thing is although the crowd could feel overwhelming especially when queuing up at the entrance, somehow when we were inside it didn   t feel as bad. Don   t get me wrong there are queues and everywhere packed but probably because of the design everybody   s dispersed more or less evenly. The food and drinks are expensive but you would expect it given such location so no point complaining. The souvenir shops are well stocked with variety and plenty of shops to temp you and kids.

"587107992,5,2018-5,Australia,""My daughter and I had a magical two days here celebrating her 13th birthday, travelling all the way from Sydney, Australia!Right from the time we entered the park on 30th May things were lovely. We loved the photographer who took our photos at the gate and later again on Main St. Her name was Harley and she made our buying the photo pass well worth it! The photo lady at the Winnie the Pooh ride was also really helpful, explaining how the photo pass worked and getting all of our photos downloaded onto the app on my phone. (She also helped me download the app and helped me sign up.) It felt so great to see the professional photos from that day and even breakfast all there, safe on my phone! I wish I could mention her name too!Although we were just able to do all of the rides in one day (we went mid week out of school holidays) we also needed a day to line up and have photos with characters. My daughter loved meeting Piglet, Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Cinderella, Aurora, Chip and Dale and Minnie and Mickey. Just be aware that the lines always seem to be really long for Minnie and Mickey and you have to be early and quick for the princesses (except Princess Sophia as she doesn't seem very popular at all).We had 12 fast passes for two each from our hotel (Disney Explorers Lodge) but we only ended up using 5 of them because there was not more than 5 minutes wait time for any ride apart from Winnie the Pooh and the Parachute Drop. We did use them for the Winnie ride because my daughter really loved it. We really loved being near the It's a small world ride early in the day when no one was around. I love that It's a small world and Winnie the Pooh are air conditioned. We also especially loved the Mystic Manor ride (also air conditioned).We took our own water bottles in and loved our meal at the Plaza Inn for my daughter's birthday. (We booked in advance but it was not busy.) The pork fillet was delicious. The other evening we ate fish bites and chips in the cafeteria at Tomorrowland which was pretty standard American food but at least it was air conditioned and quick. We also had the incredibly cute donuts which my daughter loved eating.We knew the castle was being renovated in advance but the Main Street photographers still managed to get nice photos of us with it. Main St was pretty much deserted about 3pm the Wednesday we were there so we got some great photos! Again, thanks to the lovely photographer, Harley!Well worth visiting, especially if you are from Australia as it is not as far as the USA. Thanks, Hong Kong Disneyland, for a magical visit!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Disneyland is constantly adding and renewing their attraction. However one main reasons to postpone your visit here (at least until late 2019) because the main castle is under renovation. The renovation also means that there are no fireworks show, which makes come to Disneyland is less worth these days. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"586921995,5,2018-4,United Arab Emirates,""Mention Disney, and most immediately think crazy crowds along with Disney Magic. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of my favorite parks because it strikes the perfect balance retaining the magic and charm that we have come to expect from a Disney Park while also having lower than normal (for Disney) crowds! Be sure to avoid weekends and holidays (I only went during non Holiday weekdays) when I hear that crowds can be much thicker, and you will enjoy shorter wait times, the ability to randomly catch a parade or show, and the opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace. This Disney fanatic recommends two days to be able to experience EVERYTHING in the park (all the rides, shows, parades and a couple of repeat rides on your favorites) but I realize that I am the exception and that most could do the park well enough in a single day. The unique to Hong Kong Disney rides are definitely worth going out of your way to experience if you are in the area and a fan of Disney at all. For our family, it was simply magical!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

I am registered blind and do not use any rides, however you can only have a disabled ticket and price of 100 hk dollars if you are a resident otherwise it's full priceSo it makes it very expensive day for me just to get pushed round. Luckily it wasn't too busy as this Disney doesn't do the fast pass entry for those with disabled guests either like Shanghai one does. I had to queue in the line with my daughter and son in law or they had to leave me in the wheelchair before entering line, which can be is uncomfortable when you have very little vision Most staff seem friendly, Overall good but could do better for people with disabilities "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"586780267,4,2018-6,United States,""My family really enjoyed this park. They have some great rides only found at this park. A comment that gets mentioned a lot is that this is smaller than some of the other parks, and that is true, but it is also less congested than most of the other parks by a good margin, meaning you'll ride more rides and spend less time waiting.

Even with the lines (mostly 15 20min wait) we saw almost everything. We missed a few thing because the timing plus we had a child with us, so that don   t help with timing. Over all we had a great time and what I think the best part is that since the park is smaller in size there was less walking to go from place to place. (lol)"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Smaller in size compared to other Disneylands, it makes it very bearable to walk through the park. Since it is smaller, it has fewer attractions but the essential ones are there.

586217594,4,2018-5,India,A great place to visit with the kids as they have lots of fun... but if ur an indian who eats vegetarian food. Please be cautious as to get something worth eating which would fill u could majorly be ice creams as the popcorns are also mostly caramel that is available... so eat a good breakfast before u get there. The not to miss is all the rides and specially the little world show of dolls. Fun unlimited for kids as they get to click pictures with all the characters of disney here and there...You will need 2days atleast to cover with kids... you start and end with the U.S street there are some places to eat Its best to download their app and be on time for all shows... know how long the lines are in which ride or show... definitely an enjoyable experience ,Disneyland_HongKong
"585983137,5,2018-5,Malaysia,""The most exciting part of our HK trip. To start off, we travelled to Disneyland in MTR to experience the mickey themed train! It was fab.. We loved it.. Even the MTR Disneyland station was so cool! Do not miss this.. If you have enough time.. Take the train! We stayed in Disney's Hollywood Hotel.. It was convenient.. no need to worry about transport.. Plenty of shuttle buses available from the park to the hotels. Coming to the theme park, alot of people suggested that one day is enough to cover the park, but i personally feel that if you want to get a full Disney experience then go for 2 days. That's exactly what we did and we still didn't feel it was enough..(maybe we were just too excited !)The park is big (although i read it was the smallest of disney theme parks). Be sure to get a map and the show schedule when you enter.. Take note of the shows you want to watch and manage your time accordingly. Expect long queues after afternoon at every ride (waiting time around 30 40mins). Tips : (1) Start off with the 'land' that is furthest away first to avoid queues. Some lands open after 11am..The best for us was Toy Story Land.(2) Meals are quite reasonably priced in the park as compared to in the hotels.. So we had lunch and dinner at the park (also because we waited till the final parade). Plenty of Vegetarian options available too. (3) If you have two days, watch all the shows, stage plays and parades on day 1 and do the rides on day 2. That's what we did..so we had ample time for pictures and exploring.(4) If you want to meet and greet characters, be in queue atleast 15mins before else be prepared to wait atleast 60mins in queue. (5) The castle is closed for maintenance works till later this year. There is no fireworks as well. Overall , we had so so much fun in Disney.. Loved it , recommend it !"",Disneyland_HongKong"

But obviously that was no fault to Disney, it was just bad luck. However thankfully they opened up later in the day so we really enjoyed them. We only ate in one restaurant and the food was really nice and the service was quick and friendly. The shops on main street were also really good. Full of great Disney merch at decent prices. The staff there are also very helpful. Despite there being bigger rides here they definitely aren   t    thrill    rides, but they are still enjoyable, just more on the tame side. Unfortunately they are renovating the castle so we couldn   t get a decent picture infront of it but never mind. The park is also very small compared to other Disneyland   s but we only had a day ticket and we managed to do everything so that was fantastic and worth the money.

"585488713,4,2018-6,India,""Visited on a Sunday, unfortunately, and it was one of those hot, bright days (3rd June) which meant we couldnt cover too much. Wasted too much time and exhausted ourselves at the start itself waiting for the customary Mickey Minnie photo. Skip it if the line is too long and esp if you are staying at one of the Disney hotels where you can anyway meet them at breakfast. Plan the itinerary well because its no fun going from one land to another in confusion. Its much too hot, food is overpriced, and they don't accept anything but cash for most small purchases like icecream. Although they say outside food and drink not allowed, no one really objected to ours although they checked our bags. Some of the rides like Dumbo and It's a small world are really worth waiting for, but the lines for the Winnie the pooh boat ride were so long and the ride just quite repetitive. I guess you have to prioritize based on your interests. Can't cover it all! By the time we made it to the Lion King show, we were near collapse, I was afraid my son had caught a heat stroke, and we beat a hasty retreat. Happiest place on earth? No way, not in this weather. Not at all. Be careful when you visit in May June with small kids."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"585462175,5,2018-5,India,""Its fanstastic. Specially for people who come for a holiday with kids, you must visit Disneyland and stay in the Park area itself.

Dont miss the parades in the afternoon as well as night parade as both are different. Unfortunately during our visit the castle was closed and there were no fireworks. Try to cover Tomorrowland and Adventure land 1st as there is maximumn waiting time there."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"585449357,5,2018-1,India,""You need to be smart to enjoy the HK Disneyland. Tips: Its easy to reach by the metro line as there is special metro line for Disneyland. Try to reach before the rope drop. Dont carry selfie stick as its not allowed. Pick the park map. After the rope drop just rush to the attractions of your choice and take the fast pass. Fast pass machines are installed on the important attractions and you can find it in the park map. You can avoid long queues if you pick the fast pass in advance and it gives you the time by when you need to come back for that specific ride attraction. This was you can save time and avoid queues. Please note that you can pick only one fast pass at a time. So plan your day smartly. Do try out the Hyperspace mountain extreme roller coaster and the Mine Cars.

Though most of the park is designed to look like the original Disney World, the Iron Man ride had a Hong Kong theme. Lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant (in Mystic Point) was pricey but good. This park does not compare to the original Disney World, however, it is interesting to visit an international Disney park. The cost of admission is around 600 HKD ($80 USD).

Larger walking area ,with a train that has three stops, both spoken in English ,Chinese and mandarin.

Totally totally different. I enjoyed more than my kids. The child within me was reborn.One of the best places on the earth that i have visited so far. We were there for two full days and walked around 20kms or more to cover and see each and every show and place in disneyland and no body in the group felt tired. The place lives upto its tagline   the happiest place on earth. We were so excited after first day of visit that the second day it was announced that it is a storm of 9 danger. We (including kids) were so disappointed that we did not came out of our rooms. But as it is said   when you seek from GOD with all your heart, he obliges  and magic happened. The storm warning came off at around 11am and then there was no looking back.A must must place to visit with kids once in a life time. I BET YOU WILL ENJOY."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"583784833,5,2018-5,Australia,""My wife and I came to Disneyland with expectations that we would be too old to enjoy it. Gladly we were overjoyed with the fun experience. It is a large park so expect to spend at least 6   9 hours there to enjoy all the park has to offer.Plenty of food, plenty of tourist shops and souvenirs to buy from. The rides were free, that was a surprise because we thought they may have charged for attractions but they were free to enter. The attractions, rides, tours, interactive experiences were very enjoyable and worth spending your time to seek out. Tons of things to do, you and take your time and sit around and take in the carnival atmosphere.The park was undergoing some renovations so we didn't see everything but what we did experience was a lot of good fun.Easy to book your ticket from a hotel from a Handy handset in the hotels or on your mobile phone. The price was well worth the experience, go and have a look you won't be disappointed!!! Much more than I can describe! 11 10 from me!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
583664630,4,2018-5,India,When we were heading to this place some in our group said that this place is only for the children. We will come out in half a day and go out for some other place. But one day was insufficient for the Disney land you need at least one more day. All the events and attractions were too good. Of all the paradeby 8.30pm was classic. More than the children all of us enjoyed. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"583615974,2,2018-5,Singapore,""My wife and I are Disney fans. We aren   t particularly fanatical but we have enjoyed our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and are the type to go before opening and stay till closing time. Since we were coming to HK, we couldn   t pass up the opportunity to visit HK Disneyland as I had never been before.Based on reviews online, I had already tempered expectations but even then, I was disappointed when we got there. The good thing was that the queue to get into the park and the rides was so short (we went on a weekday). I enjoyed the trackless mystic manor ride. The effects and the ride experience is one of a kind and highly recommended. Grizzly mine cart was fun too with 2 unexpected twists, no spoilers here.That   s about all the good I can really say, now the parts that disappointed:I don   t see what   s the point of letting guests in 15 minutes early to the Main Street before they open up the park proper. After they finally opened the park, I didn   t expect other parts of the park ( toy story, etc) to open at 11. They also closed earlier at 730pm. The place was already so small, surely they could organise it such that all parts of the park could open and close simultaneously.As we walked around the park, many snack stands were still closed and many cafes were closed for the day. It takes away from the festivity of the place.We were the first to sit Mystic Manor and we were excited but when we got to the ride, we found the girls standing around chatting and they looked surprised to see us. They then hurriedly rushed off to prep and asked us to wait 5 minutes. It felt like they lacked a lot of professionalism. The staff were also not enthusiastic and acted like they were there because it was their job and not because they had a love of Disney. They could fake it even if they didn   t but they didn   t bother and most looked very blas  .It did not feel magical at all. The food was also very mediocre. The crowd in general was a lot ruder than the crowd at Tokyo Disneyland. I had multiple groups of people cut in front of me while it was obvious I was waiting to take a picture of my wife and they saw me. People yelling across the street for each other. Some people tried to pick the best seats for the rides so service staff had to tell them to move down the line and they looked displeased they were told to do so.The stuff in the shops felt a little    recycled   . We saw goods from Paris Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland there. Felt almost like they were given the leftovers from other Disneyland resorts. Albert the monkey at Mystic Manor is a character unique to HK Disneyland but they were sold out for some of his goods and the sales lady said they weren   t sure if they were going to continue making it again. We went at 10, left by 430pm and don   t ever plan on going back. I expected much more and had hoped for a decent experience but I feel like HK Disneyland didn   t put in enough effort to make the place as magical as it should be, especially moreso for the ticket price they are charging. It felt like this resort is just riding off the popularity of the Disney name but it did not do it justice. If you really want to go, look for discount tickets, don   t pay full price. Go with kids since the queue is so short, they can ride the rides repeatedly and you don   t have to rush there in the morning. Also, unlike Tokyo Disneyland, there   s a proper line to do the character meet and greets so you will assured of a picture as long as you brave the long queues. It gets very hot during the summer so be sure to lather on sunscreen and bring a hat umbrella. There is barely any shade there. Use the lockers to stash your stuff, you can reopen them anytime so it is worth the money to get one. Nothing is cheap in Disneyland, the only magic I felt was how quickly your money goes while you are there.I really had hoped for more from Hong Kong Disneyland but I think I won   t ever return unless they do a major revamp, for both the park itself and its staff."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"583584033,5,2018-5,Malaysia,""Love hong kong disneyland!, try avoid month of may july as the heat is crazy! Crowd was alright during weekdays, each rides took about 5 10 minutes queue. Make sure to bring empty bottles for water refills near any toilets unless you would like to pay the ripped off price mineral bottle water. Food was expensive but nice! The cinderella and the price was kinda disappointing. Avoid renting baby strollers during summer, unless you want to bake and sun burn your baby. The main castle was closed for renovation...very disappointing again. Poor dancers sweating so much in their custume parade. Generally will visit again! Mystic manor is a must to visit!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"583568083,5,2018-5,Singapore,""Little did I know that after having a wonderful, fun filled, memorable experience at HK Disneyland with my family including the newly discovered Advance Pass for its attractions, where you don't need to fall in line and just have to go back on your designated time. It was truly amazing that means we can save time at no extra cost and maximize most of the tours in Disney.Now going back to my review is one of the restaurants inside Disneyland located on the Main Street USA zone near the entrance   Plaza Inn Restaurant. Just after the Flights of Fantasy Parade we stumbled by accident this place as we are about to exit. And with utter coincidence we are looking for a good authentic HK Chinese food in particular Roast Goose. Inspired by Mulan anime   the interior is very authentic cultural Chinese with red lanterns and intricate furnish and carvings. The service is nice and hospitable. The ambience is relaxing, luxurious and comfortable. The toilets are clean and spacious. The airconditioning is perfectly cool. We are a family of 8 with 3 kids and of course very hungry after a long day of walk at Disneyland HK. We ordered 2 servings of Yang chow fried rice good for 4 people, Roast goose, Beef broccoli, Roasted pork belly, and a Chinese oolong tea for hot drink. They don't serve free water but the drinks were affordable. True enough the one that stood out amongst the dishes we ordered is the Roast goose   savoury, succulent, juicy, tender and fresh. Despite the flavours and spices added you could still taste the freshness of the Roast goose   and most of all it melts in your mouth. HK has many famous restaurants that serve Roast goose. The flavour stands out for any combinations and it is very delicious                     The price is very similar to a typical restaurant inside the park which a bit pricey than outside but then again it is worth it. Next time you visit HK Disneyland don't forget to drop by Plaza Inn."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Comparing with Hong Kong Disneyland with other Disneyland in other parts of the world. Hong Kong Disneyland began as a tiny one. But over the last 13 years, Disneyland added new games into this tiny one. By now, I would say, Disneyland in Hong Kong is not big but good enough for 1 to 2 days if you have 1 or 2 kids to play with. I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland about 4 to 5 times. I would say, they need to continuously expand to keep up with visitors' expectation."",Disneyland_HongKong"

It was not too busy on a Sunday in May so the queues were not too long.

It was fun roller coster ride and worthy game. From Marvel hero, Buzz Lightyear ride, winnie the pooh, Tarzan and more disney related. Few places still under construction.

However, I am quite unaware about how time quickly skips by. The queues to the rides   almost all  took around 30 40 minutes. And we rarely chance on character greetings   only R2 D2 and Chewbacca at Star Wars. Mickey and Minnie and Baymax is always fully queued or unavailable. :( I think our whole day's worth of visit was not enough. But again, we had fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"582442916,4,2018-5,Hong Kong,""This is our first time to the Disneyland after 13 years since its opening. I like the size of the park for it's spacious but not too big. Every spot can be accessed easily without the need to walk too far. Thank you for all the cast members for being so professional (except for one or two) especially under the hot weather. However, I would like to suggest Disneyland to install misting system in the park before the hot summer comes. It's only May but it gets quite hot already and I can't imagine how it's like in Jun Sep. The hot weather may lower people's interests in visiting the park. I remember that when I went to theme parks in other countries, they have misting system which helps cool guests down. Maybe they should consider that too. Also, I think they should place more canopies along the pathways so that guests can take a rest from the sun during the summer. I truly hope that everyone will enjoy their visits to Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong"

All the favourite characters were there and some great rides for all ages. It's big enough to keep you entertained and small enough to see in 1 day. Expensive merchandise (as expected) but otherwise a really great day. Even with a lot of people the queues weren't too long. They are very good at entertaining you as you stand in line. It's very professional and runs smoothly. Lost my phone on the first ride and the helpful and friendly staff quickly found it for me. Our 7 year old said she had the best day of her life!

The tree house walk was also very attractive. The pooh and the lion king shows were nice too.. please remember that they give fast track time bound tickets free of cost at the attractions so that if you come at that particular time for that ride you do not have to wait in the long serpentine queues. But they do not mention it anywhere so be sure to ask their personnels standing outside the attractions. The train at the entrance of the park takes you through the park and you can get off at Fantasy land Area to explore the various attractions there. But there are huge lines for boarding this train so be prepared for waiting in long queues in this hot weather before you can board this train. Its a small world attraction is also very cute especially for young kids. There are some thrilling roller coaster rides too. The food banquet hall in the Fantasyland area has some good indian food and also has some nice veggie options. The afternoon and late evening carnivals are real fun to watch for kids and adults.

"581131471,4,2018-5,Singapore,""The experience would be excellence if not for the super hot weather. We forgot to bring along sunblock and we got sunburnt after our 2nd day in Disneyland. We went on a weekday and the queue wasn't too long. There wasn't a queue at the IronMan experience when we went over in the afternoon. There wasn't a need for Fast Pass at all. It was a pity the castle was under renovations when we visited, and there were not many theatre shows. No more Golden Mickey show, and the show replacing this was closed. The best food for lunch dinner would be at the Royal Banquet Hall. The Japanese Ramen set with chicken wings is value for money!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"581050063,5,2018-5,India,""Its a hyped park nothing as compared to the Disney in US or Paris . Ocean park is 1000 times better . Most of the rides are silly and in uncovered areas which can be difficult in summer . They don   t allow outside food and water but even when we are ready to pay exorbitant charges for lunch they provide a set Indian lunch which is tasteless and moreover we don   t have a choice . You have wait for at least half an hour in queue even for lunch !!!! Some of the rides were closed and there was no fire works on the day we went 14th May . Considering that fireworks are the must see , there was no announcement anywhere about its cancellation . Strictly avoid in summer and also during weekends . Don   t buy two day pass as one day is sufficient . Visit only if you are not planning to visit the US Disney otherwise nothing to talk about this one"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"580983877,2,2018-5,Macau,""Hong Kong Disneyland has the potential to be a really fun place, but it seems management is more concerned about cost cutting than guest experience. The park hours of operation are very short compared to Disney in USA. When they open the park at 10am, they don   t open the ENTIRE park. They open in sections which makes no sense to me. There are many outlets that have limited hours which makes it hard to even find a place to buy water.Come on HK Disney   focus on the experience of the guests. Don   t be so cheap. There is still some Disney magic here, but it could be so much better if management would focus more on the experience. Perhaps they should take their own family to experience it from the guest perspective and then they would realise how it is."",Disneyland_HongKong"

This property is very small by Disney standards but as seniors, we were treated to all the park has to offer for a whopping entrance fee of $12 US. We rode the important rides and enjoyed the perfect weather. Get there when it opens to avoid the crowds. It's easy to get to by many transportation methods. We didn't find much to eat in the park? Perhaps the restaurants are all at the adjacent hotels. Naturally, the Disney standard of great staff and spotless grounds was evident. I saw lots of kids having a great time and we got to be kids again too, The Sleeping Beauty Castle was closed for renovation so check first if this is important to your family."",Disneyland_HongKong"

But just going through all the different parts of the park will take up a good amount of time.

"580315838,3,2018-4,Northern Mariana Islands,""We've been to Tokyo Disneyland, Anaheim Disneyland and Disneyworld in Florida. This is the least of my favorite of all the Disneyland we have visited. And I can safely say, it's the same for my 8 year old son. HK Disneyland was just too small to be very crowded and unorganized when we went (Spring break 2018). Staffs were unfriendly except the older ones. Very few seem to want to go out of their way to help esp. those who did not speak the language. We were looking for a autograph album for my son and no one seem to either know nor care. Sad. It's also dirty. Lots of trash on the floor esp. the bathroom. People are just too uncaring here including the patrons. The lines for everything was just too long to really enjoy your day. Even to get something to eat or drink. I mean, the line was mostly long in all Disneyland we went to esp. in Disneyworld but HK Disney was the worst. Maybe the lines here just bothered us more probably because people around us was just not happy or friendly. Not at all the happiest place in HK!My 8 year old was initially excited to be here.... but on the second day, I didn't even have to drag him out of the park. He was ready to leave by 4pm which I was not surprise at all. He was bored or a bit in a bad mood already towards the end. There was not a lot of Disney characters around and if there was, we didn't really know nor did we find them because of the unorganized structure or program. The rides was okay. We saw Black Panther and Ironman which was the highlight of my son's day hence I gave this park a 3 stars instead of 2. Lastly, there is absolutely no grand finale here   yes, there's the electric parade but no fireworks (castle was under construction). I mean, you would think they can move it somewhere at least or arranged for something special for grand finale to make up for the lost fireworks... no effort here, really.... which is a surprise   this is Disneyland after all!! Is it? Overall, it was a miss for us... I'm not sure if we would come back here again if given another chance... At of the moment, this visit was pretty  eh ... We didn't regret it all though because at least we can say we did went to HK Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong"

579767290,5,2018-5,China,We purchased our tickets through Klook and printed them off. This worked smoothly. The castle is currently under construction but the rest of the park is functioning normally. This is a smaller park but with four kids we still didn   t fit quite everything in one day. We went on a Friday and the lines weren   t too bad. We enjoyed the high flying parade at 12:30 and were really impressed by the Festival of the Lion King show. My kids 5 9 all really enjoyed the Jedi training activity show. We tried to eat cheaply at snack stands   they only take cash. Overall a great experience. ,Disneyland_HongKong

"579707362,4,2018-4,United States,""Second visit to HKDL   Tips:(1) If you want a picture with Mickey & Minnie, they open Main Street before the park opening and they are together in the gazebo right bast the train station. Even arriving 15 minutes before park opening on a Saturday in late April, the line already took 1  hrs. Line appears deceivingly short   however, people in bigger groups want to take pictures in every fathomable combination, and there are  hidden  family members sitting on benches waiting to cut in at the last minute. You can also interact with the characters for longer than in the U.S. parks., so that's nice, but kind of painful for the people in line that are waiting.(2) Buy tickets on Klook   it's about $10 USD cheaper. Just show the confirmation on your phone at the front entrance, no need to print. Very reliable.(3) Workers do not seem to know about ingredients for food allergies (e.g. peanuts), which isn't as common in Asia as in the U.S.   so just look out for yourself and eat something safe.Overall, very fun park, less crowded than the U.S. Cute merchandise to buy   you can actually find nearly everything in the HK airport Disney Store."",Disneyland_HongKong"

579568106,5,2018-5,Philippines,Disneyland is the Happiest Place except for buying souvenirs and stuffs . But I can say that this place will make you make you want to be a child again . A place that you should not skip on visiting while you   re in Hong Kong. This is my 2nd time to visit but still I can   t get enough of it. The experience of singing with the casts while they are dancing and you dancing and swaying with them.

It was well laid out, but the size was much smaller than the other Disney properties. Lines were non existent, that was fantastic. I think 10 minutes was the longest wait time, so we never minded when the ride was a dud since we did not wait long to go on it. It was still expensive, but not as expensive as those in the States.

"578911490,4,2018-5,Australia,""We were a little hesitant in our trip to Hong Kong Disneyland as we had read quite a few reviews stating it was not worth the money. I can tell you that this not correct. Although quite a bit smaller than the American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland still delivers the magic. Unfortunately for us there was redevelopment of the Castle (which we knew of going in) which was a shame but the overall experience was great. It had some very unique rides like Mystic Manor which makes this place worth it. Highly recommend for everyone especially those with young families as places like Toy Story Land is a draw card."",Disneyland_HongKong"
578873251,5,2018-4,Australia,i love Disneyland. the shows are world class. you must go to the Lion King show. it is incredible. the costumes are just amazing. get there early though to get a seat. i was amazed at the number of seating areas there. most in the shade too. The jungle ride was so much fun. The parade was great. If you stand near the Pandora shop for the parade there is an interactive show. It really is the Happiest Place on Earth.

Avoid going weekends as it can get extremely busy. we went on a Wednesday and luckily was not that busy.   longest we waited for a ride was 20mins.   The lion king show  iron man experience is a must see and the parade with all Disney characters was great fun. its happens x2. Once at 1400hrs and then last one at 1800hrs.

"578196419,5,2018-4,Australia,""Ive visited Hong Kong Disneyland many times. This time was no less fun!2 adults and 2 kids....9 and 13yo. We all enjoyed the attractions over 2 days. The 9yo probably had the most fun though!Weekend days are much busier than weekday.The only disappointments were probably the food selection and the Theatre. The food seemed a little limited and the quality was OK, but not as good as it could be. The theatre was disappointing as its mostly in Chinese. I get that probably most guests are Chinese, but it just left me feeling rather disappointed (there are English words projected on a highly visible screen however)The highlights for me are (Hyper)space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars, along with Mickey's Philharmagic. Its a Small World is a nice calm cool break from the outside world.The Jungle River Cruise has to get a mention, as the cast members always add a bit of fun and cheekiness to it. And Mystic Manor is goods fun too!If you love non stop ride action, getting fast passes is well worth it on the busier daysI havent been to any other Disney parks, but from what I know this is one of the smaller parks. You can do it in 1 day but 2 would also be fun. Its probably more suited to the younger kids (5 12) but with an open mind, anyone can enjoy!Transport options are plenty, with the MTR popular and easy.

However, being a Vegan was something which disappointed me for the first time in my life. Finding veg food in disney is not at all easy, there are only one or two options at max available at the their various food courts. One of them is french fries which I do not like much and the other one is some Chinese dish which I do not understand. The only option left with me was to toss and choose. I guess disney shall work on this considering a lot of Indians travelling to this park every day.Please try to skip the weekends and that is what we did, still we came across 10 15 mins of waiting time before almost all the rides."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"578011310,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,""Hong Kong Disneyland is a single park and is fairly small but is great fun. It has some different attractions to other parks and the three Disney hotels are within walking distance. Being small, during busy periods it can feel crowded although the locals do not seem to flock to the big fast rides, resulting in shorter wait times. We went in April and didn   t wait longer than 20 mins for anything. One thing to watch is food choice, which can be limited and very limited for vegetarians. The parades were good and easily visible without the US obligatory 1 hour saving spaces! All in all very much worth a visit. If thinking of visiting for more than 1 day take a look at the annual pass that may be better value"",Disneyland_HongKong"
577996381,5,2018-4,Australia,Although Hong Kong Disneyland is known as the smaller park I still loved spending two days here. I would recommend to do the younger kid rides first such as Pooh's adventures as these ones have the longest lines later in the day. The two main rollercoasters were always less then 10 minutes wait so don't rush to do these. The Lion King show is a must see! The songs and performances are next level with the majority in English. The parades are also magical and even without the castle it is a great experience for friends and families. Minimal vegetarian options (although the burger in Tomorrowland was great) and I wouldn't recommend the food voucher as it doesn't save you much money and limits where you can eat. Bonus of staying in a Disney hotel is that you can get express entry through bag check and the entrance gates.,Disneyland_HongKong

"577208069,5,2018-4,United States,""We are regular visitors to Disneyland in California and have visited Disney World in Florida. Hong Kong Disney is smaller but worthwhile. This is our third visit. We feel it's great for younger kids as part of a trip to Hong Kong or nearby and for US Disney fans looking for something different yet familiar. These are some reasons why. Queues are a lot shorter than in US parks. Their most popular rides while we were there seem to be in Fantasy Land like Winnie the Pooh. Most other rides were walk on on weekdays. On weekends, longest wait we noted during peak time was ~30min but easy to avoid by going back in evening. We waited no longer than 5 10m for Mystic Manor and Iron Man in the evening. Iron Man, btw, is a simulation ride like Star Tours but BETTER!We also enjoyed the parades, especially the Spring Time Processional which featured different cast of characters like Judy Hopps, Nick the fox, and even Mary Poppins.We also like the variety of foods offered, a lot more diverse than in US parks. Several different Asian cuisines are represented, as well as American fare. This was a huge and fun difference to US parks. Though prices are still Disney high and quality to be expected which is not five stars in execution. Some may not care but bathrooms are important to me! And the few I went into were really clean, cleaner than in US parks. We paid    88usd for a two day pass, which is a lot cheaper than in the US. Even though park is smaller with less attractions, we were able to squeeze more rides in per day cuz queues were shorter. Though note that park closes early at 8:15 or 9:15pm. Transportation to the park was super easy and convenient via the HK subway system MTR. We took the MTR to Sunny Bay Station then transferred to the Disney Themed MTR direct to Disney Resort Area. I will review the resort hotel separately but want to note here that shuttle to fro park and hotel service do have minor areas of improvement."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We took the MTR to Tsin Yi and then took the Disneyland line. It's really cute. The train, train station, and the area are all themed so if you're coming here with kids (we didn't... just adults who act like kids sometimes), it's all part of a nice big show."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"576963676,3,2017-5,United States,""HK Disneyland compared to others, it's rather small, and the admission fee is not cheap, it's good for young kids, but not for adults, for elderly that reached 65, can enjoy a discount price which is HK$100 for the admission fee. There is a park before the Dsineyland, and it's free and open to public. There is a Disneyland hotel, you can have buffet there, also can have accommodation there, but the price is rather expensive."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Very expensive though (70HKD) for a flimsy plastic coat which I will not recommend people to buy. Rather get one of the umbrellas (178HKD)Food and drinks   too expensive. Noodles for 120 HKD and a Coke for 55HKDUnfortunately I could not see the castle because it was under renovation and construction.But in general, I had a wonderful time and enjoyed EVERY MOMENT of it.

Make sure you use Fastpass to speed past the queues. Go to the big ticket rides during the parade as that's the quiet period for rides. NOTE you can't take your own food in so eat well before you go as food is a little pricy. Overall a good experience but if you have older kids they'll want bigger and more scary rides.

She lives Winny the Pooh ride and the small world journey.The only complaint I have is that the food in all of the park is costly ( even for a theme park) and is not good at all.Their food standard has been abysmal for the last 7 years I have been going there.

We used our priority pass to skip the line for the slinky dog ride. They let us sit in the ride then because their dad was with the toddler and did not get a cart behind or in front and we wanted to sit together, so we got off and waited for the next turn. Once we waited for the first round to end, we were told because they gave out the bone tickets for the round after, we had to wait one more round. So we would get on the third round. Finally, it was our turn then the staff proceed to say my five month old has to sit by herself on the seat and not on a lap, I got angry. I waited there for three rounds and even sat in a ride cart and not one staff says a word about my baby on my lap. Then when I was about to sit next to my family and enjoy the ride they tell me I can   t have my infant on my lap. She can   t even sit by herself. They did nothing but say she can ride if she sits by herself and that plenty of babies ( pointing to toddlers and pre school aged children saying those babies can do it, why can   t mine) as if blind to my child   s small size in comparison. I asked for a manager, while waiting the staff that let me on the ride then kicked me off ran away to hide.If they told me when they saw me in line they should have said something then everything would have been fine. I waited in front of their eyes and even sat in a cart and three rides later they refuse to let me board the ride saying no lap sitting is just a waste of my time and use of my priority pass."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We went on a Tuesday morning and to our surprise there were no lines. The most we waited was ten minutes! The overall park was considerably smaller than the parks in the U.S.It's a Small World ride was a lot better than the rather boring ones in the U.S. The Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway MIne cars had a twist but won't spoil the surprise! We loved the Mystic Manor which was similar to the Haunted Mansion but more interesting. Toy Story Land was great and had cute rides. One of our favorite showcases involved a large book with characters portraying scenes from popular Disney movies. Some of the songs were sung in English or in Chinese. Translations were on screens which was great. The restaurants were much better at other parks. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend if you are a Disney fan."",Disneyland_HongKong"

When we were in HK Disneyland, I realized that the price I paid was worth it, given the fun & enjoyment my family experienced there. The parades were amazing.

The place was clean, attractions were very good, and the food, while being expensive, was very good. The castle is undergoing a major renovation, but it most likely needed it. My visit was during the schools Spring Break, so it was abnormally crowded for a Tuesday, but the cues were still tolerable for most of the rides.

You can meet with Micky, Minnie, Pluto, Donald, Goofy Timon, Rafiki, Baloo bear, Woody, Buzz Lightyear and others, my children were so over the moon when meeting and taking photos with all characters, this was not available in Paris Disneyland (only Mickey). Best rise was roller coaster Star wars galaxy, The Iron man simulator experience was brilliant.i went on a good day, the queues were very short. For the price of the ticket it is worth it.

For every attraction, the queue is a minimum of 15minutes. We weren't able to maximize our visit, a lot has been change since my last visit a decade ago. I am longing for a friendly ambiance not the type wherein despite you are clearly in line a kid will suddenly push your kid, lack of discipline among visitors guests are very obvious.This time didn't see much of mascots except from the parade."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The lines for taking photo with Mickey & Minnie Mouse was ridiculously long.

The iconic sleeping beauty tower that is the central heartbeat to every Disneyland looks like it   s been put in the drying machine for a bit too long and has shrunk on every side! The fact you cannot are the castle from anywhere in the Park unless you   re in main street USA just tells you how small it is! If I am honest the park entry was far too expensive for what you get in return. Especially as they have now stopped the evening fireworks and there are not a huge amount of bigger rides and shows! Even worse because at the moment the main castle is under construction so is boarded up so you can barely see it even more so now! However, as my wife and I are still huge Disney fans we still ending up having a fantastic day on all the rides, watching the shows and parades and of course walking down Main Street USA singing along to the Disney music!

A bottle of Coke worked out to   3.70 and an Ice Cream (Best part of the day) was   4.50.

"571907252,4,2018-4,Australia,""We had a very enjoyable day out at HK Disneyland. The highlight was the Star Wars ride and the grizzly gulch ride. Early in the morning and later in the evening wait times for rides are 20 30 mins however early afternoon they were well over 50 minutes. The park is very clean with lots of stores and refreshment stands throughout   considering it's Disneyland, prices were not too bad for food and drink. I just wish the park felt more Disney   no characters wandering around as they are in their own sections where you have to line up to get a photo. The parade at the end of the night was nothing special and the music playing wasn't Disney themed.There are also no fireworks anymore and the castle is currently being renovated. Overall a very good day out, but could still be better!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

571393962,5,2018-3,India,had an amazing time here. Day well spend. You can easily block 1 entire day for Disneyland. Went with a 4 yr old but most rides were suited for the toddler. Buy tickets online for better deals,Disneyland_HongKong
"571371126,4,2018-4,Portugal,""The MTR directly to Disneyland Hong Kong is the best way to reach the park.Be aware at the long queues for entrance, even if you purchased your tickets online. Again, long queues for everything inside. Sometimes you questioned yourself why they don   t set a maximum number of visitors per day.. the night parade is a must see! Love it!Toilets very clean!Kids and adults having fun all day! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
571370861,5,2018-3,Australia,Went to Disneyland on a the Wednesday before Easter and found that the crowds were not as bad as I was expecting. The park opens at 10.00am however some of the lands within open at later times. The Disney app is worthwhile using as it has real time waiting times for the rides and attractions and also a GPS enabled map to get you around however as there are only wifi hotspots unless you have data the app will drop out when there is no wifi. Make good use of the FastPass options as this can save time in queues but remember that you can only have one pass at a time and cannot get another one until after a specified time which is on your ticket. Plenty of food options available and souvenir stores and carts are everywhere. Stay for the Disney Paint The Night Parade at the end as this is well worthwhile. Get a position at the end of Main Street and watch the parade come to you. Also lets you get out of the park as soon as the parade has ended to get to the station ahead of the crowd. There were several areas under maintenance on the day that I was there however still plenty of other things to see and do. I had a great time and would recommend kids (and adults) of all ages to go.,Disneyland_HongKong
"571257877,4,2018-4,Singapore,""Disneyland around the world still gives off a magical vibes despite the size! Sleeping Beauty's castle was cordoned off for maintenance so that was a bummer but apart from that, all rides are open. I went in during the opening time and I left before 3pm after finishing all the rides I wanted to take (which is the adult ish rides)Around 2pm, queues were forming so if you guys wna spend half a day in Disneyland, just head there early.Also, HK Disneyland has a mobile app which is very convenient so you don't have to hold on to the park map. That app tells you the waiting time of the attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping etc. Pls download it!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
571170469,3,2017-7,Hong Kong,Hong Kong Disneyland as I think is the smallest Disneyland in the world. Its very crowd and everything need to queue for an hour.

"571127274,4,2018-3,Australia,""We spent 1 1 2 days here and had a great time! The queue times were quite short waited 20 mins at the most both days. Our boys are 7 & 12 and their favourite rides were Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man, RC Racer and Mystic Mountain. We were on these many times! We had purchased some kids meal vouchers from Klook which ended up being a waste of money. There are only a few locations you can use them and only 1 meal option at each so not a lot to chose from. So would not recommend these vouchers. There are a number of eateries at the park and the food was good. It's a great day out for a family! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"571123247,4,2017-7,Hong Kong,""For our 18th wedding anniversary, I decided to keep us local and to take my husband and our 2 teens to Disneyland. In the past we've gone to Macau for the weekend. We've lived here in Hong Kong for over 10 years and had never been to Disneyland, so it was well over due.I splurged on connecting rooms in the nicest resort, and they did not disappoint. The view, the spaciousness, the service, all Top notch!We were very well taken care of in the Kingdom Club, though the resort did not cater to relaxing adult time. If we wanted to have a cocktail before dinner, we had to sit in our room. The Sea Breeze lounge by the pool was closed the whole weekend, and so drinks by the poolside meant going through room service and it took 30 minutes. And ordering drinks at dinner, including Cokes for the kids, needed to be very strategic as it could take upwards of 15 20 minutes. The whole resort seems very accustomed to a mainland Chinese clientele, but we could tell the manager was looking after us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The sense of playfulness and whimsy about the place is infectious, so we all really did enjoy our time there.All in all, I'm glad we went, but for the price, we could have gone to Thailand, to be honest. We had a lovely time, everybody was very nice, and the hotel and our rooms were gorgeous, but there's no desire by either of us to go back again. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"571055253,5,2017-10,Macau,""I visited this place with my family. The children had the most amazing time. The first time we visited was on a weekend and it was really crowded. We visited the second time and we scheduled on a weekday and it's all worth it. The parade was awesome! The floats are designed grand and costumes are really amazing. Everyone is happy!!! The most awaited part was the fireworks display, lovely. It's well recommended for families with children. Must visit during winter. Avoid during summer because it's really hot!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"571010042,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,""You are never too old to enjoy the wonders of Walt Disney. However, Hong Kong Disneyland does seem to cater for a younger and less thrill seeking visitor so for those wanting big rides and thrills at every turn then this may not be the place for you. Only purchase a one day pass as this place can be easily done in half a day and remember that the weather is hot and humid so beware! The queues are relatively small, in fact we walked straight to the front on nearly every ride but I would suggest getting there at open time to avoid any queues but more importantly, avoid the temperatures. Make sure you check out the times for meeting the characters. We were rather surprised by how accommodating the characters were in the sense that they spent a lot of time with each visitor or family and happily posed for numerous phones and cameras and various poses. We would suggest getting in the queues for the characters at least 10 minutes before but the queues for Minnie and Mickey are long so get there early!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
570966932,4,2017-12,Singapore,The Disneyland was true enough smaller than the rest of the Disneylands. Queue guide was good. Usually shorter than what they stated. Good for kids above 8.

"570886770,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,""Given several visits to Disney   s US based attractions I was generally impressed with their Asian version. Rides stayed true to the originals while paying a bit of homage to new ideas....we absolutely loved Hyperspace Mountain, Grisley Gulch, and It   s a small world. Very easy to get around and I think they did an exceptional job of making sure the attractions were still enjoyable for those who spoke any English.Only complaints are that I found their WiFi to be very spotty and slow, which Impacted our ability to use the app, and the times listed on line lengths were very inaccurate.The folks on Disney   s property seemed to implement Disney   s traditional atmosphere of hospitality....the same can   t be said for the transportation segment on the way there....we found the bus driver to be very disinterested in answering a simple question...A good experience overall....not as good as the original but a very good representation for Asia."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Children or adults, everyone has something to do. Each Disney character has a space, music, rides and even dressed up live characters in some cases. The evening parade is like life enters these characters and then ends with fireworks over the Disney castle! I can never ever forget this experience and I would say this is something of a must do once in a lifetime if not every few years! It changes you.

"570288550,3,2018-4,Hong Kong,""For hardcore fans, I don   t have to say anything, they will go no matter what I said. But for the other, a few tips: First, check if it is a long holiday in China such as labour day in May, national day in October or Lunar new year in around mid Jan to early Feb. The place will be all packed withChinese tourists.Second, IMO, please don   t go on a hot summer day (which is like mid May to early Oct) It is so so hot and humid. Imagine waiting in line with bunch of sweaty people all day.Well, that leaves us on Nov, Dec, March and April, which you get the best weather, less pack.Third, buy the fast pass even if you are going on the months I suggested.

"569904547,1,2018-3,Philippines,""We went there March 31,2018. I was with my 6 yr old child. When she saw the stormtrooper mascot she was very excited to go there. We ran towards the stormtroopers and she happily raised her hand and waiting to be called. They were pointing out children or couple who will have a chance to have photos with them. My child kept on raising her hand and we were there standing for almost 20minutes. My child didn   t want to go until she was called. But I   m so tired and so I told her to go to Storm Troopers directly thinking that they will allow her since they kept on grabbing couples    who didn   t wait there   , children who just    passed by    or children who doesn   t want to have photos with them but apparently she was turned down by that stupid Storm Tropper assigned on March 31,2018 around 4pm. For just taking a photo with my child who   s only dream was to go to Disneyland made her cry because the mascots wanted to just grab people who didn   t even    wait   ! Isn   t it that HongKong Disneyland is really for kids and they think that it is the    happiest    place on Earth and staffs should make everybody happy?! That stupid Storm Tropper made my child cry and hurt her feelings! It was ok if we were rejected because we didn   t wait there for too long. But we did! We waited Soooooo long! We waited more than 20minutes for just a photo to make a child happy. With just a click and less than a minute they can already make somebody happy but that stupid Storm Tropper rejected because they wanted those who didn   t WAIT. If we were celebrities they would allow us fast but we were not! I suggest to have a new policy with the mascots! All the mascots should have a line to take photos and everybody should have a chance especially those who    WAITED   . we paid so much more that we deserve that right to have a photo with whoever we want. Hong Kong Disneyland hurt my child and I want everybody to know it because they can   t take it back again!!!Calling out HongKong Disneyland Management fix the attitudes of your mascots!

"569823535,3,2018-3,Hong Kong,""Hong Kong Disneyland is what you would expect from Disneyland worldwide   well decorated and several various theme parks. The hardware is there as it   s standardised globally   however on the soft services, I find it difficult to have rests in between rides (the wait for each of the rides could be as long as 30  minutes). Not that many vendor choices for quick rests. Number of washrooms are available but some require lengthy walks   so not the most convenient for children of younger ages. Majority of the resting seats in the parks are fully exposed under the sun without shades so it could be easily sunburned if visit the park without hats or umbrella. Majority of the F&B stops do not offer A C (but is open air) so it can be unbearable during heated summer time   do come prepared with light clothes and umbrella, hats, sunglasses and sunblocks. We already tried to beat the crowd by being the first to arrive the park, but more than a dozen tour groups arriving with large tour buses also planned the same and their stops are immediately in front of the park entrance whereas for private car park guests would need to walk further to arrive the entrance   just be mindful to wear very comfortable shoes as a lot of walking is required during the entire visit.

There is a lot of walking from one end to the other made a little more inconvenient because it   s so far and fantasyland castle is closed.

The rides we did go on were great and the street parade was fun. We got there at 10am opening and had walked the park and were done by 1:30 and had ridden a few rides, there really isn   t that many.

"567971829,2,2018-3,Philippines,""Yup. Not the happiest place. It's just too crowded that it's hard to approximate even a tinge of happiness   well maybe just for the adults. But I used to love the shiny and bright atmosphere of the original Disneyland in Orange County which one does not find here. Service is non existent, the toilets stink and the food choices are just awful. Yikes lemme outta here!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567862969,5,2018-3,United Kingdom,""On the last day in Hong Kong before flying home (at midnight!) we decided to make the most of our time and visit Disney land. We are an English couple in our 30's and arrived and opening and left at closing after the final parade.It's very easy to get to on the MTR or by taxi   we stayed in Mong Kok and it was $200 (about   20) in a taxi and we got the train back which was about   5 for 2 people.There was plenty to see and do for all ages and the park is a really nice size where you can see most things in 1 day.There aren't many thrill rides but the RC Car and Starwars ride were nice and fast and we went on a few time. Nice surprise was the Madhatters tea cups where you can manually control how fast it spins   probably my favorite ride of the day.Food options were really good and lots of things to buy. Fantastic way to maximise our last day, had a fantastic time."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567854171,4,2018-3,Singapore,""HKDL is a small park and with the construction going on, feels even smaller. It's a good park for families with little kids, or if you just want to tell people that you've been to Disneyland.We were there over a weekend in March. It wasn't very packed but it was quite busy as it was the start of their Springtime event. Most of the rides wait times were around 20 30 minutes, with it being noticeably longer on the Saturday. The park still uses paper fast passes, and only for a few rides. They make nice souvenirs though, so you can collect and keep them instead :)The rides and shows can be done in one full day but if you want to do the character meets, it will take you 2 days to cover everything. 2 days tickets only cost a little bit more than a 1 day ticket.Iron Man Experience was interesting, I liked that it was both in Cantonese and English. I'm not sure if they had multiple versions like in Star Tours. And it really made me want to eat dim sum.The best reason to visit HKDL : there is halal food and a prayer room available. The variety of food has increased and now the Main Street Marketplace (the little snack shack in between the Main Street Bakery and the Chow Tai Fook jewelery store) is also certified halal and sells (wait for it) HALAL TURKEY DRUMSTICKS. So friends, we must support, OK?The park sells meal vouchers for a discount, and while it looks like a good deal, I find it quite difficult to eat 2 square meals as their meal portions are sensibly large. Fortunately, we had Magic Access which offered a 25% discount off dining, and used that instead.The fireworks show has ended since the castle is being torn down, and instead they do a projection show down Main Street. Mickey makes an appearance at the end of the street near the central gazebo and we love the Mickey shaped confetti.Unlike Tokyo and Anaheim, HKDL opens later, which is nice because you can sleep in. There is a priority entrance for visitors with Platinum Magic Access and hotel guests, which is nice because the lines are always shorter."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567806827,2,2018-3,United Kingdom,""We visited Disneyland as overall we were not impressed. We have been to most of them all over the world and this was the most disappointing. Lots of the Park is closed off. The castle is tiny. There were only 4 good rides for adults (hyperspace mountain, iron man,mystic manor and runaway train) lots of the children   s rides were closed.Most of the restaurants were closed so we struggled to find somewhere to eat. The snacks were limited.The Disney site told us only about rides  restaurants being refurbished. Not all of the ones they just done open! They didn   t even have the park hours on the website.I wouldn   t bother visiting..... it   s a Disney let down"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567605605,4,2018-3,Singapore,""Unlike Universal or Ocean park, Disneyland does not have concept of express pass. However they do issue free fast track pass for certain key rides. Fast track pass kiosk are located besides those specific key rides. you just need to scan you ticket to get your free fast track pass, which will allot you specific time. you can enjoy other rides and come back these rides at your allotted time, without much queuing up. Only catch is, you can have fast track pass active for one ride at a time, so cannot collect token for all rides in one go, but still quite a time saving."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567558126,5,2017-11,United Kingdom,""This was our first trip to an Asian Disneyland and we absolutely loved it! It contained every bit of the Disney magic, the shows were amazing and all the rides were good fun! Definitely worth a visit."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567425118,5,2017-9,Australia,""This is the first Disneyland I've ever been to so I can't compare it with any other Disneylands, however, I enjoyed this place alot! Wear comfortable shoes and let this magical place take you away! Prepare to spend a whole day here if you're going to visit every single attraction. However I must say, if you don't have kids, I highly don't recommend  It's a small world  attraction. You'll get stuck in there for so long, I was about to fall asleep. Great for children though."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567234817,5,2018-2,United States,""I loved this smaller version of Disneyland. They had some really new and different rides, along with some of the older, traditional rides. We went at the end of Chinese new year and still the lines were not too bad, especially in the morning. I recommend you arrive prior to opening as the crowds were really light at that time of day.Being from the US, it was pretty much what I expected...same Disney feel, Asian food of course which was great. We stayed about half the day and we were able to ride most of the attractions. Attractions like the Jungle Cruise were done in several different languages, you just need to get in the line for english speakers is that's your language."",Disneyland_HongKong"
567146658,5,2018-3,Singapore,Way less crowded than in Tokyo but much smaller. The fun rides for teens like Space Mountain and Mine ride had relatively short queues. Iron Man 4d was not bad too and there is a pretty fun ride in Toy Story land too. The rest of the rides are for kids like Mystic Manor but not bad either. Tip would be to go early when it opens around 10am before the larger crowds come. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"567142393,2,2018-3,Singapore,""If you   ve been to the    better    Disneylands in Florida and Tokyo, give this a miss. Be assured that you will be disappointed. It is small, and on top of that, a bulk of it is under renovation.  Not worth a visit."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"567141240,3,2017-7,Hong Kong,""Well, I'd say this Disneyland is better suited for kids. Perhaps young adults would find a few fun rides, but most aren't very thrilling and more to a ~magical~ cruise swirls merrygoround type of rides.Food are certainly pricey but to be expected.Make sure to visit different souvenir stores inside as they sell somewhat different items at each area.Tip: DON'T VISIT DURING PEAK SUMMER"",Disneyland_HongKong"
567030257,5,2018-2,United Kingdom,Was very lucky to be able to spend my birthday in Disney during our visit. We went on a Sunday and it was surprisingly busy considering it was February.Loved how the park was set out and lots of different things compared to the other Disney parks.Mystic manor was amazing also the Grizzly Gulch are was so well themed. The castle was unfortunately boarded up which we knew before so the fireworks were not on the night we were there. Both the parades were lovely and the staff were so organised and polite to everyone.So glad I got to experience the park and would definately recommend for all disney fans.,Disneyland_HongKong
567020259,2,2018-3,Singapore,The Disneyland park is currently undergoing some renovation. Can be quite dusty n noisy. There were many groups from schools n it was so crowded wherever we went. Especially during meal times. No seats and we had to queue for around 45mins for food!No more fireworks since January. Ticket price should be cheaper in view of the fireworks cancellation since it's the highlight of the visit.My son's favourite antique car ride was no longer available... The HK Disneyland is no longer the place that we will want to visit again.,Disneyland_HongKong
566996808,5,2017-11,India,I had been here in November 2017. I felt like a kid all over again. It's a must place for the kiddies. The parade and fire works were superb.,Disneyland_HongKong
566992906,3,2018-3,Singapore,Many places were closed for renovations. However the children enjoyed the new Ironman experience. Long waiting time for most photo shoots & rides. The park should impose a non smoking rule as the guests are mainly children.,Disneyland_HongKong
"566968159,5,2018-3,Hong Kong,""I went here twice with my teenage daughters and their friends, both times on a weekend. Amazingly we were able to ride all the rides were wanted, last time even twice a couple of them. The longest wait time was 30min. This is so much better in comparison to Disney in USA where you could stand 60 to 90 min line! Note we do always come early, right after it opens so I'm sure this helps however we stay until about 4pm to watch the parade which is very cute and uplifting. The food is of course quite expensive everywhere but decent. And plenty of opportunities to satisfy sweet cravings with ice cream, waffles, churros and more. Of course there are plenty of souvenir shops to buy gifts for everyone : ) Overall I really like how this Disneyland is compact so you could go around it in a half day, no stress and no huge crowds (of course this is Hong Kong so people are everywhere still but not crazy). Definitely worth a visit with kids or even for adults to just have fun! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"566949277,5,2018-3,Australia,""A great day out. Lots to see and do for all ages. As in most cases there in often huge lines for popular rides, but they do let you know before entering the time to wait before you can get on the rides. The Disney story time musical is a must see. Food was pricey. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"566611890,5,2017-8,Indonesia,""It was a very wonderful holiday after I had a competition. The rides were very spectacular. The favourite snack there was a squid with chili. The ride areas were very clean. The servers were very professional and very kind. It was a little bit crowded inside, but the Disneyland show was very wonderful. You should go there, trust me you will be surprised to see all the spectacular views. Anyway, it wasn't too expensive to get inside."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"566287043,4,2018-2,Canada,""As expected HK Disneyland is a smaller scale than DisneyWorld but it still has the iconic Disney layout and attractions with a local twist.

"566272363,4,2018-3,United Kingdom,""Small, with just a few major rides, but clean and beautiful. Well organised, efficient. On the day we went, a Tuesday, it was not too busy. However in consequence, food stalls and some rides and shows closed up at 6pm, when the park was officially open to 7:30 the day we went. Also, there was a lot of construction, with the castle and several other areas cordoned off. I estimate 10% of the park was closed, so not happy to be charged full price, added to the early closing of stalls and shows. Not to Disney standards. But otherwise great atmosphere, and running smoothly. I noticed that some of the electrics on the light parade were not working, so the park could use some maintenance. That said, toilets very clean as we're the walkways."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"566266272,3,2017-12,Indonesia,""We   ve been at Disneyland Japan to compared it with, and obviously this was not as good.

565927863,3,2018-3,Singapore,Visited yesterday amidst great anticipation as our last visit was two years ago and we knew there were some new attractions as well as some old ones we wanted to revisit. Checked the website not much info. Reached there day started well at new Star Wars attraction and iron man show but soon discovered attractions like mystic point supposed to be brand new down Down due to technical error and Lion king show was also closed and toy story parachute ride was also closed. Mind you these are all star attractions! How can a park charge full admission when three star attractions are closed??!! This resulted in crazy queues by mid afternoon bec each ride show you can imagine should have been able to take a few hundred people off the track at each point!!! We left by 430 after the parade bec the crowd had gotten to the point of ridiculous. Sure people can fit into the park but with major rides closed this is not fair to paying customers flying in from overseas!!! A partial discount or meal vouchers should be offered when more than one major attraction is closed. Disappointed and unlikely to come back again.,Disneyland_HongKong
"565786146,3,2018-2,United States,""In all fairness, we went during Chinese New Year holiday.The Cinderella castle was closed for repairs.This one is considerably smaller in footprint & variety of activities.Didn't seem they integrated the Chinese culture into the design & execution, it's very similar to the one in Orlando.Food offerings were good & diverse.Ticket price was reasonable.Very convenient transport, used MTR the whole way from Hong Kong island.Food stands take cash only"",Disneyland_HongKong"

"565588949,3,2018-3,United Kingdom,""For someone who is an avid Disney fan this park was disappointing. It   s too western and shows no oriental culture. They don   t even celebrate Mulan. The castle on mainstreet is miniature and laughable compared to Paris or Florida. Two small rollercoasters, no fast speed thrill chasers. There were no parades on and lots of things were closed for refurbishment. It lacked the Disney magic you feel in other parks. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

It is very easy and inexpensive to get there by subway and to transfer and ride the special disney train is a delight and it stops at the front gate.

"565345077,4,2018-2,United States,""Went with family during Lunar New Year week and was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't too crowded. Didn't wait for more than 30 minutes for any of the rides. I kept hearing how it is smaller than other Disney's around the world but it had enough rides and attractions to enjoy for a full day. We went when it opened in the morning and stayed until the very end of the parade and was not bored. Also loved the fact that we were able to take photos with Mickey and Minnie dressed in Chinese costumes, although had to wait in line for almost an hour for that."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"565044655,4,2018-2,United States,""This Disneyland, is very similar to others, but it is on a smaller scale. Having been their twice, both on relatively crowded days, we still only spent less than 6 hours there, including lunch to cover most of the popular rides and attractions. Of course we could have stayed longer if we wanted to hit every ride, but because of the relatively smaller footprint and repetitive attractions from other parks, we spent most of our time checking out those things that might be a little different. Food is not very good at all, from any of the three restaurants we tried. It is still a great place to go, but don't expect to be wowed by the experience if you are Disney veteran.

We worked our way from F Land to Toy World, kids go nuts. Then went through Wild West where Grizzly ride is. Tarzans Tree Touse was ok., to get there was a short trip over canal. Not alot of eateries no Down Town Disney here. Small World was really good.

"563138984,4,2018-2,United Kingdom,""My 4 and 6 year old children love Disney so where better than the happiest place on Earth. My 4 year old is 102cm exactly so we were still able to get on quite a few rides. HK Disneyland is incredibly easily accessible via MTR with a Mickey themed MTR train. But this time we chose to drive and it costs HKD220 to park the car for the day. The roads were very easy to navigate and the car park was near to empty, arriving at noon we parked in bay 5. The park was quite quiet and we had to wait no longer than 30 minutes for the rides which was perfect for us. We didn   t plan our day very well and missed the lion king show but were able to catch all the other shows. Even though HK Disneyland isn   t very big we still didn   t have enough time to get around all of the park. We missed out Adventureland. The rest of the park was well thought out, well presented and easily accessible. The toilets were well placed throughout the park. They were all clean with toilet paper and hand paper was available (locals will know this is rare!). There was also a choice of regular toilets or squat toilets. Every toilet we visited had baby changing facilities. We knew in advance that the fireworks had been cancelled so we weren   t disappointed. We used the time to go on extra rides until the park closed at 9pm. As with any Disney attraction the food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced. We still had some snacks from the many food stalls and also ate the set dinner at the Plaza Inn. The part that made the day really special for us was that my 6 year old was approached by a staff member to take part in the princess parade. For this she was sat in a prime seating area (only one parent was allowed to accompany her) to watch the parade and join in the dance with the Disney princess float. It truly made the visit memorable. Thank you Disneyland HK for making our visit so special!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
562958373,5,2018-2,United Kingdom,If you have ever been to Disneyland Paris it is the same but a shrunken down version. The good thing about this is that you can do basically everything in one day.

We arrived at 930 and had no delays getting into the park.if you can buy (fast pass easy pass) tickets already along with your entry. Yes a little more money but well worth it. Every body has there own likes but the iron man and Star Wars rides are great. Even some of the rides shows that we weren   t really interested in , we went on(because of fast pass tickets) and surprisingly we enjoyed them. At around lunch time  1oclock it starts to get really busy, so be prepared. Food stalls and seats become very busy. My suggestion is to eat very big breakfast and wait until later afternoon to eat"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"562407550,5,2017-12,Philippines,""Second time here, mostly because it's just a short plane ride away.Lines can get long, but if you get a package that includes a hotel stay, things get a LOT more enjoyable and more convenient.While at the park, I highly suggest downloading the HK Disneyland App for alerts and maps."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"562233646,3,2018-2,Malaysia,""It may have not been a good year (or probably month) to visit because they're renovating the place and there are lots of attractions that are closed when we were there 2 weeks ago. They also hiked up the ticket price starting January 2018.During our stay, 2 of the attractions that we went to malfunctioned so they had to close it for about an hour or so. Picture taking with Mickey & Minnie also have specific timings and they cut it short very early (around 4:00 or 4:30 PM). I could be wrong but I don't remember them closing it before 4PM on my previous visits few years ago.Don't get me wrong.... Disneyland is still a very fun place to visit in Hong Kong.

The attractions are mostly geared toward smaller children but the park is well maintained and easily do able in a single day if you use FastPass. (You get 3 Fast Passes with a general admission ticket). The Lion King theater show was particularly good. Best of all, a regular ticket is about $75 US, and if you are over 65 it is about $13 US.

561202250,4,2018-2,United States,Reasonably priced day of fun. You need to get there early and expect 40 minute lines at a lot of rides.

"561114590,4,2018-2,Indonesia,""I'll start by reminding you that all Disney properties are clean, efficient, well maintained, family freindly, staffed by friendly and helpful people, and have lots and lots of Disney magic. All that being said, I found Disneyland Hong Kong to be my least favorite of the four I've visited. Maybe my expectations were a bit too great, but I found that it's a little small feeling, and it seems like there are fewer attractions and definitely fewer shows than other Disney properties. The things that they do have are really good, but we were pretty well done before the sun went down on our one day visit. If it's your only Disney opportunity, definitely go. If you love Disney definitely go. Just know what to expect."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"561064503,4,2017-10,United States,""We've been to both Orlando Disney and Tokyo Disney and had heard that Hong Kong was no match for either of them. We went into the park with low expectations. There were definitely some downsides to the park, but for the most part, we left feeling pleasantly surprised. THE RIDESAll the rides are super fun and innovative, and even the big ones have short lines (30 minute wait at the VERY most, but usually 10 minutes). They are exciting enough for the older ones (my teenage granddaughter loved all the rollercoasters, the new Iron Man simulator, and the Mystic Manor trackless ride  so did my 40 year old children, in fact!) but also appeal to the younger ones and have low height restrictions so my 5 yo granddaughter was able to ride EVERYTHING in the park (a first for her). THE SHOWSWe watched a live performance of Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The visuals were stunning, performances were great. Tiana stole the show with Almost There, but I must say that Elsa disappointed with Let it Go, the performer was NOT a strong singer. The dialogue was in Chinese but with English subtitles. THE FOODMeh, especially for the prices  although you MUST try the caramel popcorn! Meal vouchers are a good idea and saved us 12 bucks (USD) and we got 3 vouchers for caramel popcorns with the meal vouchers. I recommend eating at the Explorer's Cafe. THE SERVICEAlso meh, especially after having visited Tokyo Disneyland and WDW in Orlando. People did not go out of their way to assist us as in the other Disney parks. Other guests were visibly cutting in line but the Cast Members turned a blind eye. Overall, it's definitely worth a trip. If you go in the off season, you'll experience short lines and be able to do the entire park easily in a day."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"560956841,4,2018-2,Russia,""We have been to this Disneyland twice. So, tried all adventures for adults and for babies this time. To sum up: our daughter loved it very much and didn   t want to leave. There is a wonderful attractions for the children of 1,5 4 years as fantasy land, Pooh   s house, orbitron, jungle cruise and many others. A lot of interesting small spots to discover fairy tails. So, if you have children below 6 years old they will love it. For adults I would recommend to visit Ocean park, it if more interesting. Also I would like to note, that it is quite hard to buy healthy food for the baby on the territory of park, we have seen mostly sweets, cakes, etc. so it is better to take something with you. It will be great if some healthy food cafe will appear in the park. Most part of visitors are from China, though all attractions are mostly in English. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"560829232,5,2018-2,India,""The dilemma:Whether to take the two day pass or one day pass? Looking at reviews feedback, I took one day pass. In hindsight, it was a wrong decision. I went with a 8 year old kid and her pace is not the same as mine. With a 2 day pass, I could have covered all the rides in a relaxed manner. The cost of two day pass is only little bit more than one day pass and it is a good deal.Positives:  Paint the night parade is superb.  This was my first Disneyland trip. I realized that Disneyland is not about high tech rides. Much more thrilling high tech rides can be had in any big city around the world. Disneyland is about carefully curated fantasy. It is not to be rushed through but savoured slowly. The 19th century USA ambience is created beautifully with attention to details. Roaming through these does not need any queue.  Once paint the night parade is over, one can return to city by MTR or taxi. There are folks at taxi stand (possibly Disneyland staff) who really help.Negatives:  I wish some people could have taken things a bit more easy. It should not be about ticking away a bucket list of rides, cutting queues, covering most rides in minimum time. I can understand the excitement of kids but I cannot understand the impatience of parents. Why create the unnecessary scarcity mentality?"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Kids there are extremely rude and pushy, constantly cutting in line, and the parents don   t seem to care at all. I ended up yelling at a few and blocking them from cutting. The food is by far the most expensive out of the 3 Asian disney parks, and the worst. PhotoPass   NOT worth the money. All other parks had photopass photographers throughout the park. The ONLY ones this park has are with characters. So unless you want to wait in line all day for 2 3 photos per character, don   t waste your money.

"558940615,4,2018-2,Malaysia,""This is my first Disneyland. Bought ticket from Klook for the convenience. There was still a long queue getting in at 10:00 on a Thursday. Like everyone else, we took the special Disney train from Sunny Bay. We thought we were too early when we got there before 09:30 but a huge crowd was already waiting. So we waited in line. The gate opened at 10:00 but we were only allowed into the game area at 10:30.Our first stop was the Iron Man ride. Some people actually took the fast pass and went ahead to other rides. Thought that it is smart to get fast pass for the few rides that offer this. We didn't attempt to do it. The queue probably took 15 minutes. Then we entered the special ride area with our 3D glasses. The ride was fun, one of the best, but rather short. Next we tried the Mystic Manor. There was no queue. While I enjoyed the ride, it was even shorter than the Iron Man ride. The other highlight was the show   Mickey and the Wondrous Book. We lined up for an hour before we could get in. The line was badly managed. The moment we were allowed to go inside the compound for another queue, kids and parents started running in, ignoring the initial queue. It was frustrating. The show lasted 28 minutes. The other attractions we tried were Tarzan's tree house, Disneyland railroad, It's a small world, The many adventures of Winnie the Pooh (not worth the hour long queue), Slinky Dog Spin and Mickey's PhilharMagic (nice 3D show). By afternoon, more people turn up, leading to long queues at all the attractions. Some additional information:1. Avoid the fried noodle from the stalls if possible.2. Download the Disneyland apps. It provides information on queue time and also rides that may not be opened. We found out beforehand that Hyperspace Mountain was not available when we were there. 3. Queue wisely. Sadly there are always individuals who try to cut queue discreetly.4. Toilets are well maintained and clean. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"558932183,4,2017-7,India,""Well   . visiting Disney Land for the first time itself sounds absolutely Thrilling!!It   s kind of more for kids and family entertainment. It was an amazing experience for us though. But for hard core rides & coaster lovers I guess this place won   t work for u guys. However, reaching there wasn   t a task for us as we stayed on Lantau Island itself and the journey from hotel to the park was too short coz our hotel provided shuttle to Disney land which got us there in just 15     20 mins, while people travelling from other places will take more time than usual but its hassle free, MTR which is the second best option I would suggest, because while returning we missed our shuttle, we had to travel through MTR and it was a nice experience.The fountain of Mickey on a giant whale was quite welcoming. Especially kids, you could see the excitement in them watching those Disney characters. There was a live Mickey and Mini interaction when we entered and clicking pics with them which gave a kick start to the day. The rest of the rides were nice and we enjoyed a lot. Also, would suggest to make proper use of maps and the timings mentioned on it for the rides so that you don   t miss any being Sunday the wait time was not more than 15     20 mins.One small disappointment for us was the food coz being an Indian we would prefer Asian or Indian meal but we couldn   t found any options other than European food, especially after those tiring activities anyone would wish to have a meal of their choice. Also, the Indian restaurants that were shown on map were all shut and there was no update regarding the same coz it was far and we had to search walking which was very time consuming.But at the end the very famous Disney Fireworks (09:00 pm) a not to be missed stuff, is a treat to the eyes and it makes you forget the entire day   s tiredness.Over all experience was wonderful and would really suggest to visit once in your life."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Several attractions are there for kids. I will suggest to buy Disney Souvenirs should be purchased from any market in city. If you purchase it from Disneyland it will cost very high. So better purchase any rain coat, umbrella or Disney cap outside of the Disneyland. Fast pass price has several benefits. it saves time. If you are with little kids you may need fast pass because on most of the rides there is a lot of rush. so kids either get irritated in long queues or they miss some rides. Tips for visitors:1) Avoid visiting on sundays or holidays. There will be a lot of rush. Local tourism is china is very high. Locals visit to these attractions so try to avoid visiting on holidays or festival days to save your time and visit with peace of mind. 2) Go to the place as early as possible. Early in the morning there is no rush so if you want to enjoy all rides without fast pass you can do it easily. Fast pass price is very high Disney should slash the price."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The most we waited for a ride would have been 30 minutes. The rides were all really well put together and bought the characters to life.  It's a small world  and the  Pooh Bear  were my personal favourites, plus make sure you wait around for the end of day parade the lights in this are amazing and very good.Some not so great points: food variety wasn't amazing, there wasn't a heck of a lot of vegetarian meal options and the snacks and meals were very expensive (I would recommend taking in a lot of food for snacks especially if you have kids). There weren't enough characters throughout the park during the day. We only managed to see three characters, and we were there from open til close. Some of the park just looked a little bit tired and unpolished. Also some of the main characters were no where to be seen within the park and rides.

557692260,4,2018-1,Australia,One of the smallest Disneylands we've visited but had all the Disney characresitics and the standards are second to none. You can get a two day pass which works out well if you wish to visit a second day. The castle and few more areas are closed for construction. Overall a good Disney experience and Iron man show was our hightlight. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"557645467,5,2018-1,Australia,""We absolutely loved Disneyland, as did our kids (9,10,14). We had spent a day at Ocean Park the day before and had read that it was better than Disney, so were a little worried, but nothing could be further from the truth.We'd also been to Paris Disney, and this is absolutely comparable. The Disney experience with the Asian touch is really spectacular. I'd recommend making the most of the fast pass, which you can use once at every ride (no additional cost).We were able to get through the entire park in one day, but it was a very busy day   non stop. The food isn't great, and typically over priced, but that wasn't surprising.The rides are all great   favourites were Iron Man experience and Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The train to Disneyland was also Disneyland themed so that was nice. The great part was how easy it was to get to on the train. I preferred this over Tokyo Disneyland "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"557299083,5,2018-1,South Africa,""Disney Land is a must for all Hong Kong travellers. It takes you back to your childhood. Seeing the fairytale stories come to life is breathtaking. Everything is done with excellence. From the parade to the shops, displays theme parks etc, its out of this world. The park is managed very well everything is in place. The security manages the crowds very well and efficiently. A definate must for all visitors to Hong Kong. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"557274893,5,2017-12,Indonesia,""Been several times to Disneyland and trust me this is the only Disneyland where I could finish all the rides in one day. The park wasn't that big. But still fabulous and enjoyable. I went there last Christmas, the longest waiting time to take the ride was only 30 mins...this is quick compared to my previous visit to Japan (2 hours!) Make sure to take notes on the show time. All I can remember is LION KING at 12pm. Food was okay, not many choice but OK. Waiting time was also not long. So everyone was happy then.My fav ride: mining roller coaster...forgot the name, it is located in the jungle land area close to Lion King.Also, they provide rental for stroller.

"556831717,5,2018-1,India,""This was our second visit to Hong Kong Disneyland, the first one being in December 2010 and it was a pleasure to experience the new rides and shows. The best part about Disney is that it never disappoints no matter how high your expectations are set at! We took the 2 day Play and Shop package which I believe is only available online and is serious value for money. You can make the second visit anytime within 6 or 7 days of the first visit! My parents who are close to 70 basically paid only 100 HKD per person per day which is 1 6 of an adult ticket price. The kids loved almost all the rides and characters. Food options could be better but then who goes to Disneyland to eat? Get to the park 15 minutes before it opens and start from the Adventure Land side. We did that on day 1 and it worked better than the other way around that we tried on the second visit. We skipped weekends. Do not miss the parades (there are 2 in a day, both totally different), Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Manor, Space Mountain and Iron Man rides especially if you have kids over 10 with you. Highly recommend shows such as 1) Mickey and the Wondrous book and 2) Phillar magic! Its a small world is good for older people and is generally not too busy. Have fun and let Disney bring out the child in you again!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Like all disneyland, it is the happiest place on earth, you getto meet all the disney characters at randon and at different times of the day. I guess the only difference is the language during the show. So make sureyou catch the english version, althou, if you get to watch the cantonese version, they do have small screens on both side of the stage where they flash the subtitles"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"556775046,4,2018-1,India,""Good experience. Children loved it. Can be done in a day unless you want to do every ride, which may not be the case. The only thing that was terrible was that there were absolutely no options for vegetarian food. Absolutely none except some corn. Now, if you   ve set up a world famous theme park, people from all over the world are going to come. There would be so many who may look for veg food. It   s not a localized theme park which will be visited by locals only. And in this part if the world visitors from India will be so many. Needs so more thought on that one !! But other than having to eat only corn all day the kids loved it. Please get the food variety right! "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"556437406,5,2018-1,Malaysia,""We travelled to Disneyland and stayed in Hong Kong Disneyland hotel for 3 nights. The first night at Kingdom club room and followed by 2 days in Deluxe room. Our kids loved the Story Telling session and Mickey   s appearance in pyjamas before bed in the club level. One of the perks for staying in the Kingdom Club, truly amazing experience. We left our kids lunch box in the fridge in the Kingdom Club. When we are back to our Deluxe room, the Club   s housekeeping was so kind enough to put the lunch box into our new room fridge. (contains our kids cheese). We also got the luggage shifted to our Deluxe room. Very convenient and thoughtful.When I reached the hotel after the park day 1, we also got surprised with 2 Mickey Mouse plush toys, a bunch of Helium Balloons, birthdays cards from Mickey, cake decor with towels and decorations in our rooms.Our kids (son and daughter) loved the plush soft toy from the    Three Magical Days    package. Our daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse and when I asked the front desk helped me to changed it, it was changed immediately without any queries. My daughter was so excited and she was sleeping hugging the Minnie the whole night.We were late from the Disney park after the Night parade and headed to Walt   s cafe for dinner. We have been provided food and table at around 10 pm without any hassle. The staff and the restaurant was so efficient and fast and also very knowledgeable in the menu. The staff also advised me about the dinner promotion of discount of $100 for $400 minimum spend. We   ve got that discount and a great dinner. On the last day of stay, we enjoyed the Character breakfast dining with Pluto, Goofy, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Definitely a lifetime experience for all."",Disneyland_HongKong"
556414565,4,2018-1,United Kingdom,We was very pleased with our visit. The attractions are very well designed and very impressive. It's very well laid out and easy to get around. We loved the characters however there should be more of them walking around because we only saw three. Only downfall is the obvious pricing.   4 for a can of Fanta. Come on Disney we paid   100 to get in you could at least make the prices better. Overall enjoyed it. Very expensive. ,Disneyland_HongKong

It was a showery morning on an unusually cold day in Hongkong when we arrived. After checking in our hotel we went to see Disneyland starting from one of the most famous street of merriment in the entertainment world, Main street. This street is well known for all who have visited Disneyland in any part of the world. For those who are planning to make a visit to Disney, this is the street where Mickey & Minnie, Pluto & Buzz and all the Disney characters perform their much anticipated parade at an appointed time where most if not all visitors lined up both sides of the street to watch all these famous characters walk and dance in choreography.

This was my second time to visit HK Disneyland and I noticed that there were new attractions. It will surely unleash the child in you. Bringing in of food is allowed as long as it is not a full meal. Chips, cookies, candies were okay. Drinks were also allowed. My tip is to buy water outside before going there as the price inside is much higher. Enjoy the day and wait until 7:30pm for the Grand Parade, It was worth the wait. Find yourself a good location to sit along the Main Street USA early as the whole street becomes full packed before the parade."",Disneyland_HongKong"

At the end of it we were asking if that was it. After lining up and being jostled around by the crowd we felt shortchanged.Staff at the souvenir shops were snooty   so why would people be happy in buying way overpriced Disney stuff we could get at lower prices elsewhere?There was no ride that I could say was super fun.

"556004064,4,2017-11,Hong Kong,""We took the train from Kowloon to HK Disneyland at 9:30am and we got to the park at 10am. The bag check and ticket checking process was quite smooth. The day pass was quite pricey so you need to go early and stay till they close to make it worth it. Going there early during the week can avoid the crowds, which usually starts around 1pm. Even the place is small, there are still a good number of rides to play at the park. The kids wanted to see the castle and we walked down the main street to get to the rides. Our route was Main Street    Tomorrowland     Fantasyland    Toy Story Land     Adventureland. Had lunch at Starliner Diner...very expensive for low quality food! Some people brought snacks for their lunches. Wish we had done that too.Played a few more rides after lunch and we left the park at 6pm. Totally forgot about the traffic. The trains were packed!!! If you don't have a stroller but you have young kids, you can rent a stroller for HK$120 per day with HK$100 refundable deposit. There are many stroller parking areas which was very convenient.Tips: download the Disneyland HK app to see the waiting time for each ride. It's pretty accurate."",Disneyland_HongKong"
555848329,3,2018-1,Singapore,First time to any Disney Park. Was expecting it to be magical but we found the place somewhat muted.Maybe it was the crowd. We even saw a kid peeing at the sidewalk.

It was my first time I visited the place in Hongkong, The place is very happening, beautiful and well designed, the time you step you into the place, you will get into the delightful memories of your childhood. I went to the place during Christmas which made my experience better. The place is very crowded so I recommend to take a 2 day pass if you are planning to go especially on weekends or public holidays so you can enjoy the most of it. Don't forget to attend the evening firework and Disney parade. They have dedicated mobile applications which will give you an idea about the timetable and wait time on rides."",Disneyland_HongKong"
555787849,5,2018-1,India,HK Disneyland is small as compared to US one but it is worth it. This is a must visit for a child(once in a lifetime). The shows and Parades should not be missed.

"555723927,4,2018-1,United States,""Four people three generations all adults. Love this happy place! We live in the northeast part of US. Visited Disneyland and Disneyworld at Florida and CA many times. Each time involved plane ride and long traveling time and hotel expense. Not this one. It was so easy to get to! 40 minutes train ride and here it was! The last part of the train ride (the ride that dedicated to go to Disney) was a pleasant surprise: the cabin was decorated with playful color and lovely designed seats. Never seen before. And there were rides that were uniquely Hong Kong Disney too. We enjoy them all. Even my 80 years old mother in law got onto the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars twice! I am a clean freak and all facilities plus overall park maintenance earn high my marks. It was a weekday and a bit rainy. Not crowded, which contribute to the easy and relax and cleanliness. But not happy that some places were closed, such as the castle and small world and many restaurants. Plus no firework. That took one point away from rating. Oh try the turkey by the food stand at the main street. Not as good as in CA but good enough if you miss turkey. It was 3 times bigger than the display. Do not let the display fool you. Finally have to praise all the workers. They were very professional and pleasant and did the right thing when they saw people cutting line."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Once again it   s an unmistakable Disney experience but it   s quite small relative to other Disney   s.I guess we were in the off season (January) but we only waited for more than 10 minutes on one ride (Parachute Drop was 20 mins), but most were less than 5 mins.As for characters there was a queue to meet Mickey Minnie and Donald on Main Street. But we waited only a couple of minutes to meet the princesses at the 11am appearance (Cinderella & sofia) and Winnie Eeyore.I guess the downside of going in the off season is the risk of ride closures for maintenance which for us included the castle and one of our favourite rides   Small World   as well as a couple of other attractions.One of the highlights was the Mickey & the Wondrous Book Show. The Fairy Tale Forest was sweet. And the best ride was the Runaway Mine Cars.The parade was quite quick (seemed shorter than usual).Don   t bother with the Disney Railroad."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The place was terrific, of course: wonderful ambience, castles, great rides for the kids, meet and greets with Star Wars stormtroopers and Chewbacca, plus a parade of Disney stars. Even the food at the cafe was better than expected. I think I was expecting the staff to be a little...warmer. sunnier. Friendlier. I mean, this is Disneyland! Shouldn't they be a little less..brisk? And much more like people working in a place of dreams and magic? But dont get me wrong, they were professional and courteous. Maybe I was just expecting the Disney spirit to be really strong here.

Moreover, although larger and newer Shanghai Disneyland had opened, popularity can't be diminished in one seconds. When I'm across several popular attraction, long queue can be seen clearly. Merchandise store that not so large invaded by huge amount of tourist.Despite these, the attraction and fabulous parade can forget long queue issue. I'm enjoy so much during that time.I'm glad to see concern and priorities among disabilities. Wheelchair user will get priorities to enter attraction without should wait for a long time.

Queued for an hour plus to take photos with characters such as Mickey and Donald.The rides were not as exciting as the ones in Tokyo and Paris. Food there was average too. Sadly there is no light shows   fireworks anymore. But still a nice experience for those who never been to Disneyland before,Disneyland_HongKong
"553983874,5,2018-1,Turkey,""Easy to get to via the MTR system, Disneyland isn't cheap unless you are a Senior Citizen, when a Day ticket is just $100hkd, very good value if you're in your 2nd. childhood. Iron Man and Grizzly Gulch were both brilliant, whole park is very clean, and you don't need to be a long distance athlete to go all the way round it, it's reasonably compact without feeling that everything is packed too tightly together. The attraction very much exceeded our expectations, we'd happily go back if somebody can get us to Hong Kong again !! "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"553862918,3,2017-12,Australia,""Was here over the NYE break on a weekday. Didn't have any high expectations but in the end it was still not super exciting for our 2.5 year old. We managed to do all the rides he was allowed to go on within 1.5 hours..by then the lines were already very long. Once we had lunch, the queues were up to an hour for silly rides like DUMBO the elephant (going round in circles??). The fastpass system they have is not for every ride and not the most convenient. It would be great if you could buy a priority pass like in Ocean Park.We did manage to watch the Festival of Light show (basically a 25min condensed version of the Lion King) which I thought was really good. I suppose unless your kids or you yourself are a huge Disney fan, Disneyland will not be much of a big deal. We went to Ocean Park a few days later and found it was much better value both for kids and adults....10 times bigger and with heaps more things to do."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The others which are not as popular, aka no lines such as photo ops with Chewy were great too. As there was nobody after us, kids were able to have more time with Chewy."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Our son (age 9) got to do his Star Wars on stage and our daughter (age 7) did her princess bits.

There was hardly any queuing. We decided to try out the rollercoaster. Didn't realise it went backwards. Whilst everyone else were hands in the air me and the Mr were screaming our heads of. Was fun but never again.Also did some sort of boat ride.

We spend more than HK$600 for dining for 5 persons (2 adults, 3 kids), toys are expensive also... queues were long for most of the rides, need 2 days to try almost all of the rides, yet still not tried all of them. This is definitely park for children under 12 yrs old. Maybe for older kids 2nd time visit will be a bit boring already.

553448273,5,2018-1,Australia,A great couple of days for the Kids we grabbed the 2 day pass the first day we arrived early & it was wet & miserable weather wise. Which meant we didn't have to wait for any rides the only down side was the parade was an inclement weather parade with characters on a float singing & dancing as it went past only a small version of the full parade. The second day the weather was better we arrived latter & had to wait 10 15 minutes for rides at most we saw the full parade at 3:30 Pm which the kids loved. & continued on rides until the light up the night parade which was spectacular. There were no fireworks over the castle as they were in the middle of som renovation in that area. The MTR is so easy to use & efficient mode of transportation to get there & back. All in all a must do in Hong Kong with kids. ,Disneyland_HongKong

It can be a long day with the parade around 19:30 and fireworks around 21:00. A 2 day pass is ideal as it can get very crowded and due to the long queues for rides, you might not get to do everything in 1 day.There are a few opportunities to get photos with Disney characters, but we expected to see more like in the Paris Disney,"",Disneyland_HongKong"

"553086728,5,2017-12,Malaysia,""My first visit 7 years ago was good, but I remembered that I was done by 3 pm, meaning the rides must have not been too engaging and the place was smaller compared to the other Disneylands.This trip our group arrived at almost 11am to no queue at the ticket booths. We got our tickets slightly cheaper on Klook, but we wanted physical tickets as souvenir so we had to do exchange at the ticket booths. Oh, it is so worth it for senior persons to visit Disneyland Hong Kong at HKD100 only! Super envious!Same thing for the meal vouchers. We bought on Klook cheaper compared to buying on site which was HKD235 for the 3 in 1 meal coupons. Absolutely worth it to buy this deal as you get to exchange for set meals of prices HKD120 & above each for lunch & dinner, plus a snack. The Mickey Minnie ice cream will cost you HKD39 & popcorn HKD32 35. You do the math! We never even got to use the HKD5 discount for water coupon, as we got bottled water with the set meals anyways (if you don't take soda, coffee tea add HKD10).All the attractions were great fun and our most recommended would be:1) Mystic Manor (the only one in the world!)2) Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh3) Mickey's Philharmonic4) It's a Small World5) Slinky Dog Spin6) Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (not for the faint hearted!)We covered more than 11 attractions right up to the fireworks at 8.30pm. If u want more time for the rides & to shop, u shud arrive once the park opens. After 4pm, the queues were noticeably shorter. Overall, we didnt have to queue more than 30mins per attraction.As for food, if you have the 3 in 1 meal coupons, just head to Royal Banquet Hall for lunch & Explorer's Club for dinner.

But for my young son who just love to look around, its not a problem. A small tips that useful for us.

"552763761,4,2018-1,United States,""If you can only spare 1 day to visit and have young kids in tow, this Disneyland couldn't be more perfect. With a footprint much smaller than the Anaheim or Orlando locations, even the furthest more points of the park are no more than a 20 25 minute walk from each other, even with a tired child in tow. We had heard from friends who are Disney enthusiasts that the rides at the HK location had more advanced technology (ergo would be funner) than their much older cousins in Anaheim and Orlando. This was not the case   we discerned no difference between HK and the Orlando location, the latter of which we had visited only 3 years earlier. The smaller scale of the park is best reflected in Main Street (considerably shorter than Orlando) and the diminutive  Magic Castle  (w a much smaller size compared to Orlando) almost made me laugh out loud. In any event, there was plenty to do and despite making use of all three (3) of the park's  fast passes , we literally found ourselves hurrying from ride to ride during our 11am 8pm visit.If you are anywhere within walking distance of an MTR stop, definitely consider taking the train to from Disneyland. From Central or Kowloon, you simply take the orange line to Sunny Bay then transfer to the Disney dedicated shuttle train.Disney's policy prohibits  food and alcohol  and contains considerable restrictions on size of backpacks and strollers. We saw no attempt by Disney security to enforce these restrictions. They did indeed search bags but only the main compartments of backpacks and purses and it appeared solely to confirm there were no large scale weapons. If I had to do over again, I would not hesitate to pack plenty of food and snacks (not surprisingly food at Disney is expensive!) and to bring our child's full size stroller so that he was not as tired fussy towards end of day evening. Disney also has a bag drop office located outside of security so in the unlikely event you encounter an overzealous security guard you can always leave your giant stroller or cooler full of food there. Tips Suggestions  Don't hesitate to bring your own food drinks  Stroller bag size restrictions don't appear to be enforced  If you arrive at opening, start with the rides furthest away from entrance (you'll likely face no line), then work your way back towards the entrance  Both the afternoon evening mainstreet parades are worth seeing, the evening parade includes lots of lots of neon lighting."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"552111145,5,2017-12,Japan,""We went there 29 30 December 2017, staying in one of the Disney hotel helped a lot because we just took shuttle bus and visit the parks in the morning and comeback and rest in the afternoon before head back for firework and night attraction. Our favorite attractions are Big Grizzly Mountain and Parachute drop, highly recommended. Parades were great as usual, especially Xmas theme related shows. Firework was also second to none. The only point that I kinda dislike was F&B in terms of price, long line to purchase, and taste was just decent. However, you can bring your own food and drink inside as long as you carry them with your backpack.Tips:1. Go there early, and go inside to Toy story zone first so that you can enjoy attractions then walk back up front for other attractions and parades.2. Like other Disneyland, foods and drinks are allowed as long as you can carry in your backpack (luggage with wheels is not allowed) Thus, bring food and drink so that you save some money.3. Use fast pass, when possible and also you should download Disneyland Hong Kong app (very useful because it tells you how long you have to wait for each attraction) 4.

"551858612,4,2017-12,Australia,""Being a 90s kid, watching the likes of the Lion King, Toy Story, and Tarzan, visiting Disneyland brought me back to the 90s.So much variety, from rides, to food, to merchandise and photos with mini and mickey mouse, Disneyland Hong Kong has something for all ages (But mostly for children). Mad sure to book online prior to arrival, you may enter the park with online QR code tickets (this helped as I didn't have to line up to get tickets. Arrived around 12:30pm, on the Disneyland train which was exciting. Line up to get into the park was short, once I was in, the park was packed. With park entry you are entitled to receive three fast track entries to any ride, you must go to the ride and scan your ticket in the fast track lanes and come back when the ticket advises you too.Made sure I grabbed an English language map then took the train within the park to check out the entirety of the venue which gave me an idea of what was in the park. Visited the Iron man and star wars ride within tomorrow land, the jungle river cruise, the  its a small world after all  ride, and Tarzan's tree house. Took a photo with Minnie and Mickey Mouse (Had to line up for over an hour).Make sure you stay until 9:00 pm for the fireworks at the parks close. Merchandise is expensive just like any other theme park and or zoo. Food is also expensive, but there is variety depending on the area you are in. Tomorrow land had burger and chip meals, near the jungle river cruise their is Asian foods. Throughout the park there is a number of pop up stands which sell ice creams, hot dogs, popcorn, drinks and snacks. I was really surprised with the waiting lines for rides, although it seems at first you may have to wait a while, the lines move quick and if the sign at the ride says a 60 minute wait realistically, for me it was a 35 minute wait which was good. Sadly didn't get to see alot, because there is so much to do, so I recommend getting a two day pass.

We visited during Halloween, the Villains night time parade was spectacular, the temporary haunted house was great, but probably for bigger kids.Highlights included the IronMan Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Jedi Training, and Grizzly Gulch. Other attractions are still great, though the long line for the Winnie the Pooh is somewhat weird, I recommend using he fast pass system for that one.Food was good, thankfully, as there are no breakfast other options. We had a quick service at tomorrow land which was filling and great Value at HK$99 for a meal. And a nice meal in the Main Street Restaurant which was pricey HK$660 for two but still very nice.It is warm during the day, but most lines are in the shade or air conditioned except for the smaller rides eg Orbitron and Dumbo. And It   s a small World is always worth the effort.We got a free fast pass for staying at the hotel.

Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man Adventure, Toy Story Land, many parades, many charactersThe staff is always happy and professional in character. The Main Street is filled with shops for shopping and more shopping. It is not as crowded as other Disneys around the world. Yet it has enough attractions to last a day. Use the FastPass to better manage the queue times. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"551290660,5,2017-12,Australia,""This Disney is great forthe younger family, it has a handful of exciting rides that you 7 year old will go crazy for while still keepingnyour 11 year old excited. Its easy to get around and has all the magical feeling you expect from Disney. Big tip is get there for opening time around 10am as its the quietest time and youwill have the shortest wait times. Also plan our your use of the fastpass (only one can be used at a time) this will queue for you while you take a break or queue for another ride."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"551201394,3,2017-12,Japan,""I've been to the Disneyland in Florida and Tokyo and I've to say that the Disneyland in Hong Kong is small compared to them. I was kind of disappointed when I saw the castle. The rides were not as exciting as the ones in Tokyo and Florida too. Although the Disneyland in Hong Kong is smaller than the ones I visited, there were way too many tourists and it was impossible to take all the rides. As such, I missed out on some exciting rides. The queue average waiting time is about an hour or so. You can opt for FastPass at some of the attractions such as the Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride. The Disneyland also closes at 8.30pm. However the fireworks displays begin at 9pm. Food is expensive. It's about HKD100. It is an overpriced pleasure, but its still magical!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
551129906,5,2018-1,United Kingdom,Two big kids enjoyed the whole Disney experience. The attention to detail in the park and the quality in the rides made for a fab day out.We booked a one day ticket but spent all day there (approx 10 hours) until the park closed after the fireworks finale. We felt a day was enough as the park is quite small in comparison to anything you get in USA and therefore we walked around at least twice and covered all the rides we wanted twice too. The queues for most rides were under 30 mins without paying for a fast pass. Our tip would be to buy any gifts and memorabilia when you arrive as the stores were quiet and you can leave them with guest relations to collect end of the day. The queues at the tills at the end of the day were crazy!,Disneyland_HongKong
"550910972,4,2017-10,United Kingdom,""We were visiting Hong Kong for a week and thought it'd be worth a shot to try out Disneyland there. We weren't expecting big, and we expected it might be a bit different from Florida, but thought it would be a great one day out. The rides were great, especially Hyper Space Mountain and all the Star Wars theming of Tommorwland. The food was pretty good. The lack of all the princess stuff was a nice bonus. It was easy to get to from Causeway Bay and the restaurants had plenty of space. We never had to queue more that 15 minutes for any ride (it wasn't a holiday there). On the negative side, that castle is comically small, no Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the shops are unbelievably crowded. Would recommend for a day out, not for a whole week."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"550599343,5,2017-12,Singapore,""Visiting Hong Kong with an 11 year old meant a trip to Disneyland was always on the cards.Getting to Disneyland is very easy with a dedicated Mickey Mouse inspired spur line off the MTR at Sunny Bay on the Tung Chung line (orange).As soon as you get off the train you know you are in a Disney resort. It's clean and there is a cheerful atmosphere.We spent our day taking in the faster rides now that our daughter is tall enough to ride them. The Star Wars HyperSpace Mountain ride is excellent and wait times are minimised with the freely available fastpass tickets.The RC Racer ride in Toy Story land is a basic pirate ship type of swing ride but styled like a radio control car and if anything a little faster, certainly more thrills than a normal pirate ship ride.The Big grizzly Mountain Runaway mine cars ride was closed during the day but opened later in the evening. This was a boon as we were able to ride this attraction 4 times in a row as the rest of the park had gone to the main street for the parade.Tarzan's treehouse is looking a bit tired and frankly dated... time for rethink there I would suggest. That said the adjacent Jungle River cruise was good fun.The Jedi academy in Tomorrowland was also good fun, 11yo getting to train with other Padewan Learners and ultimately go up against Darth Vader and his apprentice. All in all we had a great day. Only saw one Disney character (Alice) all day but as our 11 yo wasn't that bothered about photos and signatures neither were we!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

My only complaint is i dont see much disney characters going around. When we were in paris we always see them almost every corner of the huge 2 park. But here u rarely see them. We where saying maybe they are short staff? My daugther was dissapointed coz we did not even see the original disney characters only mickey and minnie and donald the electric parade was awesome!

It   s also cheaper. Some of rides can queue for approx 30 45 mins.Food wise, There are a variety food offerings in the park from chinese to western meals. Set meal with a main course and soft drink will set you back approximately HK$100 150.We stayed there for the fireworks. It   s the last few shows before they shutdown the fireworks for a long period of renovation. The show was spectacular. Unfortunately they don   t offer it already.

Iron man ride was an enjoyable. Son also enjoyed the Jedi training which you have to register at the gift shop next hyperspace mountain. Make good use of the fastpass where possible (mainly for hyperspace, iron man & winnie the pooh rides). Toy story land was nice. The castle is relatively small & not accessible.

We used the Disney railroad from main Street USA to fantasy land. We went into the fairy tale garden and took some good photograph. Then, we queued up for the festival f lion show.

As usual the food and drinks are ridiculously priced and in most of the park's food places it's cash only. The day we went the average wait time was about 30 minutes and the weather was perfect.

After 27 years in a wheelchair I had gotten used to it (which is messed up in itself), but I found that once I had children people realised I could most likely respond. I had my three year old in my lap 90% of the time and my six year old nearby.

There are only (4) thrill rides in the park. In our opinion the Runaway Mine Train was the best. Think Thunder Mountain but with a few twists. Hyperspace Mountain is a small scale version of Space Mountain and will appeal to fans of that ride in the US. The Iron Man Ride is a simulator and very good. Mystic Manor is a must see! It   s a hyped up and fun version of the Haunted Mansion and the technology and special effects are amazing!There are limited food options through the park compared to US parks but quality is very good.We visited on a Friday and crowds were manageable.

"548759733,5,2017-12,Singapore,""I am impressed with Hkg disneyland in many aspects. The service provided was extraordinary. Their staff is friendly and polite unlike the Japanese in Tokyo Disneyland. Most people wld have expected the service from Japanese to be better but i beg to differ. In tokyo, we were rushed into rides with unfriendly ushers and they were really impatient as they frowned and shouted. In Hkg, my experience was totally different. They were polite and told the visitors nicely where to exit in 3 languages, eng, mandarin and cantonese. Even in states, the service was on par. Tokyo Disneyland is a letdown when we visited last yr. i will say not to waste extra money gg to Tokyo and settle with Hkg Disneyland! "",Disneyland_HongKong"

There were only two restaurants open, but as it was easy to get a table and the food was OK.There were no queues and we were able to get on all rides and attractions with minimal queueing.

"548564466,4,2017-10,Philippines,""I have to say, I love Halloween and the best time to visit Disneyland for me is during this season.

I have yet to go to Disneyland during another season, so am sorry if this review isn't much help :) the weather during this time is good enough to be out. Not too hot and not too cold. Plus the number of people weren't that overwhelming. Still best to go early so youhave ample time to roam around, rest and recharge, and have a go at it.It will be a bit weird for English native speakers to watch Mickey Mouse and Co. speak Mandarin during some of the Live Shows but trust me it's no issue in the long run.

I rode most of the big rides (7 rides including big grizzly bear my favs, mystic manor, its a small world, hyperspace mountain, and other small attractions) The wait time is between 0 10 minutes MAX! Which is super awesome coz we dont have to que and stand in line for so long. The food tho quite disappointing, I ate at banquet hall(if im not wrong its the castle foodplace) and ordered fish and fries, my sis got hamburger and fries, and my mom ordered some noodles. The foods were bland :( The cafes pastries and bread are really good, i ordered this flaky chashiu pastry and ice milktea it was really tasty!The staffs and cast are lovely, helpful and nice, toilets are clean and big, they also have water fountain for u to drink free if u dont mind drinking from tap water.Unfortunately I did not stay for fireworks :    but for my first disney park experience I enjoyed it so much!!One tip for you all the merchandise are ofc overprice(its disney what do u expect) I recommend u to not buy the    foods    items inside the giftshops such as candies, ramen, lollypop, etc, why? Cause they are soooo overprice and you can get ur own disney themed candies foods outside disneyland!!! For example i bought this gummy candy from the park and it cost 65 HKD the. I went to best mart 360 guess what I found same exact candy for 12 HKD!!!! And guess what they have other candies with better taste and packaging with DISNEY LICENCED as well!!!

Incredibly short waiting times made experiencing the park a breeze and we were able to go on the rides more than once. The entertainment was incredible, from the parades to the firework show! Getting to the park is super easy with Hong Kings train system, the trains are super efficient, cheap, clean and safe, I stayed in Kowloon east and it took under an hour to get there, taking 2 trains both only about a 10  15 minute journey and then taking the Disneyland train which is an experience in itself.

"546321081,5,2017-12,Hong Kong,""If you   ve never been to a Disneyland this is a good introduction to what Disney has to offer. If you   ve been to Disney in any other country, consider this a miniature, manageable one day version of it. The attention to details are to be admired. A lot of rides and attractions are localised, especially the Ironman Experience (which replaced the Buzz Lightyear ride). Most narration is in English, Cantonese and Putonghua, with some being in Cantonese only (Animation Academy). The Mickey Wonderous Book Show was all in Cantonese except the singing parts. However there are subtitles and it doesn   t really take away from understanding of the the graphics show. The restaurants are nothing special. The quality of food is below par and are overpriced. When we went three of the main restaurants were closed so food choice was limited. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so we had that option instead. I didn   t see any drinking water stations. We went on Saturday and Sunday. We ended up not needing the fast pass. Lines were 30 mins max. The lines which were 50mins plus we skipped until later in the evening. If you get to the park as soon as it opens, you can fit in most of the rides before noon. Late afternoon was when it got crazy busy. The evening parade was spectacular. Very impressive. The fireworks were impressive as they are much lower than most firework displays so it was extremely bright. The accompanying music was what made it extra special. And the fake snow comes on right after which was fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"546099512,5,2017-11,Singapore,""Visited Disneyland for a couple of days and the Christmas decoration and programs were very nice. The crowd wasn't too bad and we could easily find seats during dining.

You can walk the main street up to the Christmas trees all day without a single Photographer."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"546098363,4,2017-12,United States,""If you like California Disneyland you   ll love Hong Kong Disneyland with its similar compact size. The park is laid out in the same pattern as its California counterpart   pass through Sleeping Beauty   s castle to enter Fantasyland, turn right for Tomorrowland, etc. Of course, there are key differences that make this park special, including hearing instructions in Cantonese before English, watching mainly Chinese cast members perform, and dining at restaurants featuring a variety of Chinese and Japanese items along with American hamburgers. It is at once a fun and cultural experience.My two favorite rides were The Iron Man Experience, a motion simulator movie ride that has Iron Man saving downtown Hong Kong Island, and Mystic Manor, a high tech reimagining of The Haunted Mansion. But no ghosts appear in this through the dark ride. Instead it retells the weird stories of explorer Lord Henry Mystic and his too curious pet monkey Albert. There are surprises funny and scary at every turn.The stage performances are top quality, including    Festival of the Lion King    with special effects, choreography, and singing on par with    The Lion King    on Broadway. My only letdown was the Iron Man Showcase when the hostess began by announcing    Our presentation will be Cantonese    and began to explain the various projects without one word of English. I was completely lost. Fortunately when Iron Man spoke, his words were only English. (Did this confuse the largely Chinese crowd?) A day   s visit here is worth the time, and you probably can do everything in one day if you come when the park opens and play all day, enjoying lunch and dinner on site."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The night time parade (Light the Night) has characters from Monsters Inc, Lilo & Stitch and Cars as well as Mickey, Donald, etc. I recommend getting the Photo pass as the photographers take plenty of photos and also do the  magic shots  with characters added to your photos.

Having visited WDW Orlando and Disneyland Anaheim our expectations were pretty high and you exceeded those expectations. The entry process was quick and easy and the staff were very friendly. Download the app before you go so you can study the map and attractions etc. this also gives you the wait times for the attractions and you can also purchase your tickets from here. The lines for the rides were minimal and the most we had to wait was 20 minutes at one stage of the day. A few of the rides and attractions we had seen before and thought it wouldn   t hurt to skip them, but having to wait less in queues meant that we could enjoy all the attractions. I   m glad we had time for this as almost every ride at HK Disneyland is different than the other parks in the USA.    Disney paint the night    was absolutely fantastic, a great addition to the nighttime entertainment. Food was a little over priced as always with any theme park but we found plenty on offer.

The musicals and live shows are really good, though.The bad part was the photographer for those character photo session was not too friendly, required an autograph book or any writing material from Disney even though Cinderalla was willing to sign it. Overall not really friendly for kids below 7 years old as the queue is too long for those rides suitable for them and price is insanely expensive for food and rides."",Disneyland_HongKong"

It will cost you less and your children will definitely enjoy this place. As compared to Disneyland parks in US and Europe, this is a smaller version in terms of scale but for your children it will be equally enjoyable and memorable. From Hong Kong Central station going to HK Disney is very easy and convenient. Just be sure you have wisely budgeted your money specifically for this trip as the cost will not be as cheap as you would think, it is going to be an experience though for your kids."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We stayed for the fireworks at 8pm which were spectacular, and the fake snow really put a magic touch on the show. Highly recommend staying to see this.

There are some restos but I think it   s expensive. Maybe it   s just me. In the evening when you   ll all tired from walking and you want something hot to eat because it   s already getting cold outside, you come across this eating joint where they serve good food but the place is not well lit.

"544141605,4,2017-11,Singapore,""We have just returned from Hong Kong and have spent 2 days in Disneyland. November is a great time to visit, the weather is cool and it does not coincide with any China or Hong Kong holidays so the park is not crowded.Our plan was to complete as many rides on the first day and then we look at taking pictures.We had skipped all photo taking opportunities with Disney Characters and headed straight for the Ironman experience. It took us 15 20 mins to get on the rides.The ride was great, and all my kids aged 11, 9 and 5 loved it.It definitely pays to stay in one of the Disney hotels as it allows you access to priority queue to enter Disneyland.After completing the rides in Tomorrowland, we moved on to Fantasyland where we had our lunch at the Royal Banquet hall. Dining within Disneyland is pricey and not worth the value but Royal Banquet hall is one of the best places to eat.After lunch we headed to Grizzly Gulch where the Big Mountain ride was what we feel the best ride of the day. it was a 30min queue but this is peanuts compared to the queues we had at Japan Disneyland.We moved on to Mystic Point where the only attraction worth mentioning is the Mystic Manor. The ride is interesting with a tinge of scary feel to it (it was enough to spook my 9 year old..in a good way) and created a bit of excitement to weary bodies late in the day.After dinner at the Bakery (as most places had long queues for dinner) we lounged around main street to snap photos of the neon lit buildings. We made our way to the center garden and waited for the Parade to start. It was more magical lights with our favourite characters. It was awesome to see Lightning McQueen and Mack and the other Disney characters such as Toy Story Characters, Belle and beast.Fireworks came after the parade and the whole main street was filled with artificial snow since its 1 month away from Christmas. The lights on the Main Street buildings were mesmerizing.We went back on Day 2 and joined the queue to have a snap with Mickey and Minnie. They were great and duly obliged with hugs and were patient but the queue took more than an hour. I have the luxury of my Mrs in the queue while I took the boys to wander the Main Street attractions such as riding on the Taxicab. They would not have stood well in the queue. If you have only one day in Disney I suggest you skip this.We explored Adventure land after lunch and went up Tarzan's tree house and went on the Jungle River Cruise.The one show you shouldn't miss is the Festival of the Lion King in Adventure land. The performance is awesome and its not easy to keep my 5 year old engrossed in something that is not animated. We went back for 2nd rounds on some of our favourite rides such as Big Mountain, Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience.We found some food trucks that serve packaged local fare outside Disneyland that is really affordable so that is where we ate for dinner on the 2nd day."",Disneyland_HongKong"

However the 4D effect is slightly worse off than those in USS, not a adrenaline pumping. The rest, more suitable for younger kids.

People are also quite rude, had a couple incidents of grown adults running past us (with a 3 and 5 year old) pushing us to get to a ride. Not Disney's fault of course but doesn't lend to a pleasant experience.

The park was empty except after 4pm which made it difficult to see the evening Halloween Parade. Disney has free water & free seating all over the park for a great comfortable day. The very long Disney rides have moving seats so you can rest while enjoying the adventure. They also have great sit down shows where you also rest. At other amusement parks you stand all day for rides seconds long. There are so many wonderful adventures here at this park. It is great for parents because you are not forced to go on bone crushing rides, because they have imagination rides instead. The Lion King Show was the best, my 4 year old loved the Iron Man simulator though it was a little rough for my wife & It's Small World is a family Fun Boat Ride. The Jedi training for only very small children was a great treat for me & my wife. They hired really quality actors to play in this realistic training of a Jedi Knight. The kids believe they are doing it. The mine ride roller coaster is great without knocking your teeth out. The Mystic Manner was my favorite ride of a spooky house of a rich antique collector, though my son was hiding under the ride chair. You take 100's of photos everywhere you turn. This park is so beautiful and so clean (except the dinning area). Donald Duck 4D movie (spitting water) was good after second view, my son could not pick up the concept the first time around. Meeting Mickey Mouse on Main Street (@930am before the gates open at 10am) in all his royalty was a highlight. The early parade is better because the crowds have not arrived yet.The night time fire works show is one of the best in the world. The Chinese government had the biggest fireworks show in maybe the world the day before we went to Disneyland, so Disney kind of switched there show to a multi media fireworks lights sound themed show which made it very unique.Even with the empty park, there were no empty tables to eat food at in there dining rooms (this is something they need to fix).You will have a very long day at Disney because no one leave until after the wonderful night time fireworks show. There is a 730pm night parade than 9pm fireworks.

It you have the time fellow seniors, do it!One point, they don't like you taking food in but our cheese sandwiches were allowed and our bottle of water.It gets hot, take a fan, Sun umbrella and cream up.It gets very busy later in the day so go early.The biggest queue was for Its a Small World, we hardly queued for anything else.We didn't stay for the fireworks   perhaps we've seen too many fireworks already?

It was a good day, quiet, and with no long queue. The size of the park makes it manageable, not just for young children but for older people. best to being camera, umbrella or hat to cover in outdoor exploring activities, and wearing a very comfortable walking shoes is a must. Its good also that we already purchased our ticket (entrance and meals) online to avoid the hassle and queuing lines. It was an experience for my older companions, seeing how delightful they are and how they feel young again. Disneyland never fails to unleash the child in us again.

Only 3 4 good rides for this one   Hyperspace Mountain (faster and more impressive than its cousin Space Mountain), Grizzley Gulch railroad ride (again faster and more variation than Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in LA), Ironman ride (comparable to Space Tours in LA) and the Mystic Manor (  Haunted House in LA). We went for the day but were done by around 3.30pm.

We stayed until mid afternoon, there were 2 parades during that time, both were good with a lot of sing and dancing. Heaps of souvenir shops line the main walk way.

"539863613,5,2017-10,United States,""Thanks to HK's efficient MTR system, this place is very easy to reach. Go there at least 45 minutes before opening because by opening time, there's already a huge build up of people waiting for the  flood gates  to open. And when they do, people run toward the most popular rides to try to beat each other out of the line. Our first ride was the Iron Man Experience   careful, lots of motion in this 3D theater but fun. If you can, plan for a two day visit to make the most of the park especially if you have kids in tow. My favorite experience was  The Lion King Show . Don't miss this for anything else there. Also, if you can purchase food vouchers inclusive of your tickets, do so. I did two meals and a snack   for each of my family members and I'm glad I did because we planned and did stay there from start to finish. This was a better way to save money than having to purchase individual meals there.That said, for next time, we would just buy one meal (preferably dinner that is redeemable after 4:30 PM) and a snack (a choice of popcorn or ice cream stick anytime) for each person and just eat a heavy breakfast before leaving home or hotel. My favorite meal was the  Singapore Laksa Noodle Soup  at the Tahitian Terrace (you can redeem vouchers at other restaurants as well). The Indian Tandoori Chicken meal was  blah .As for the fireworks display, try to position yourself somewhere in the Rotunda of the Main Street to have the best view of the fireworks when they conclude the day. If you have kids (or you're a kid at heart) ask the attendants for stickers, even the janitors themselves happily give them out for collecting. And, bring a water bottle. Drinking fountains are a bit scarce there (there's one by the Iron Man Experience) out that's the way to stay hydrated and saving money at the same time. If you're used to Disneyland in California and Florida, don't expect the cast to be as friendly. They are, just not U.S. Disney friendly. At least that's my personal opinion. Enjoy!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

It was incredible! The singing, the dancing was 6 stars !The 3pm parade and the paint the night parade at 630pm were awesome! The energy from all the performers was infectious! They looked you in the eye as they past, they waved and high fived my kids, tinker bell blew kisses to my son and made him feel so special as did the Dances in the jumping Tigger costumes. They were so talented.The park was spotless as were every toilet I went to and every eating area. Even the lady taking our order at the Comet diner was so friendly and talking to my kids and I in English. Food was good to!Every part of my 3 days here was amazing.

"539614263,3,2016-12,Hong Kong,""If you are wondering whether or not to spend a day at Disney Hong Kong, it all comes down to for you are looking for.  How much do you like thrill rides?Disney HK is quite tame on that regards, with Grizzly Gulch and Space Mountain being the most ''extreme'' rides, the latter being already a slower version of the attraction.   What's the age group?Due to the above comment, a younger audience might be more appreciative.A high energy group looking for some round the clock fun would probably be disappointed by Disney HK.   Would you go mainly for the rides or for soaking up the  Disney feel ?As it's been pointed out by many reviewers, the number of attractions isn't huge and many are not rides. Some visitors come to mainly walk around and enjoy the scene. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a day packed with numerous attractions and thrill rides, HK Disney won't probably cut it and Ocean Park might be a better option."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"539556247,5,2017-11,Hong Kong,""Originally we were unsure about taking our toddler to Disneyland, but after reading a few blogs advice we decided to give it a go. We had a great day!  The park is a lot smaller than the original Disney in California, which I saw as an advantage. It's flat so easy with a stroller (although we only took our carrier). We caught the train, which takes you straight to the entrance. I was surprised by the number of rides we were able to take our toddler on, Fantasyland was a particularly good for this. I'll list them below:FantastylandDumbo the Flying Elephant   simple up and down ride that she loved. We had to ride separately (only 2 per carriage).It's a Small World   a little nervous about the dark initially, but loved the music and charactersCinderella's Carousel   horses are quite high up making it difficult to stand next to the toddler if you sit them on a horse. We had a carrier which made it easier, I just hopped on and she was happy to hold the pole.Mad hatter's Tea Cups   closed for maintenance :( but easy to ride with a toddlerThe Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   got a bit scary in parts (darkness thunder lightening)Fairy Tale Forest   Loved wandering around this, she happily bopped away to the music. Mickey's Philharmagic   she sat on my knee and bopped away. Did get a little loud and dark at timesTomorrowland Orbitron   very simular to Dumbo ride but in spaceshipsNothing else was suitable for toddlers ToyStory Playland Slinky Dog Zig Zag Spin   Simular to Dumbo and Orbitron but a bit fasterAdventureland We didn't make it here but the Jungle Cruise and Tarzan's Treehouse could be doable with a toddler. Theatre in the Wild   Loved the Lion King Show!!! Highly recommended!We didn't stay for the parade as our toddler was so tired. There are 2 parades   3pm and 6.30pm. Fireworks at 7.30. The food was ok, but i recommend bring snacks for the toddler (you're not supposed to bring food into the park, but as long as you're not packing a picnic they seem to overlook it).We went on a Tuesday and got there as soon as it opened (10.30am) so the park wasn't crowded and the lines for the rides were 5 10 minutes maximum. Discount park tickets and food vouchers are available through Klook and simple to redeem. We just went straight to the turnstile when we arrived.

Our longest wait was to visit with Cinderella who could not have been more gracious and kind to our kiddos. She had to be melting under her gown, wig, and makeup but she took great care to give each guest her undivided attention. All of the live shows were excellent entertainment! The Lion King was quite wonderful. We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel so we were able to break up our day, rest a bit, and return in the evening for uncrowded rides and a spectacular fireworks show.

"538740219,5,2017-9,India,""We were allotted just a day for Disneyland, located on Lantau Island, in our package tour, and I knew it would not be enough from experience. ( I had been to Disneyworld in Florida and in three full consecutive days I had not been able to see all of it. ) We were awestruck by the beauty, the colourful displays and the cleanliness when we entered the Magical Fantasy Land ! We tried to work out a schedule according to the times and places where shows would be held, as detailed in the free brochure, but soon had to give it up since running from one location to another to keep up with the timings in the vast place was well nigh impossible. Trying another more practical approach, we started exploring with the help of a guide map also provided free. Still, in each attraction we could see only one or two parts before moving on, lest we miss out on many more.Being Sunday, there was a special parade from 3 to 4 and again from 7 to 8 p.m. We could enjoy a boat ride through a  jungle  with mechanised, very realistic animals, had lunch at The Explorer's Club ( there were country   region wise food areas,which sold mostly fast food and also some ethnic dishes ), saw many fairy characters and read a few pages of stories from books displayed on pedestals. We could visit or see stalls of Spider Man, Iron Man and Merman, had a tram ride and also saw The Toy Story. In the evening we enjoyed a song and dance programme in the auditorium before returning to Main Street to watch the display of fireworks at the end of the day. The entrance ticket included all rides and attractions and we did not have to pay anything more except for food and drink and souvenirs of which there was a plethora to choose from at various sales points. Some staff members gave away stickers with pictures of characters and attractions..We boarded our coach to return to the hotel, thrilled, tired, but yearning for more. SPECIAL MENTION : It had become very hot during the day. One of our group members was on a wheel chair and one of the rubber tyres became loose due to the heat. We tried to fix it back, but in vain. We were so grateful to a strong well built Philipino gentleman who helped us get back on track.At the auditorium, the differently abled person was given priority and accommodated in a vantage position along with her escort.RECOMMENDATIONS : 1. Plan for at least two full days to spend at Disneyland to be able to enjoy yourselves at leisure   more if you have young children, who would enjoy rides of which there are many. You have to queue up in many places for which some time should be allowed.2. Carry your own drinking water   it is exorbitantly priced inside !"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Highlights of Space Mountain, Toy Story parachutes and Mystic Manor went down a total storm with our kids as did the Lion King and 3d cinema. What nearly proved to be a disaster was accidentally locating the Elsa character greeting, completely hidden and that was what our daughter had been going to the park to find and went down less well was the one hour and 20 minute wait to get access to the Minnie and Mickey character greeting, a second set of characters elsewhere on park would resolve that for very little cost.

The only proper, worth seeing attraction is the parade which happens around 7:oo pm in front of the castle. The rides are fit for kids from 5 10 years old. Teenagers who love the princesses can visit the garden and children lovin thrill can go to tooy story part. It's almost same as compared imagic in lonavla, but with lesser rides.

Did the rides, ate there and stayed for the night parade and fireworks. Well worth it. Arranged for a tour to collect us from hotel. This way didn't have to worry about trains and buses and lining up for tickets. and the best thing was that the bus was waiting at the entrance to take you straight back to hotel   especially after a long day at the park. Take a plastic poncho with you as some of the rides you will get wet. And yes   buy the Mickey Mouse t shirt too!!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"537994836,5,2017-10,United States,""My husband and I scheduled a trip to HK with no prior plans set. When he suggested going to Disney I was so excited! I have never been to Disney so this was a chance to check that off my bucket list. We preordered tickets through an app for a small discount. This allowed us to go in without queue (which seemed short anyway). It was the weekend prior to Halloween so the parade was villain themed (7pm). You'll want to get there early for a good seat. At 8pm there are fireworks over the castle, so stick around. We mostly went for the rides so I can't really comment on the characters as previous people have. We did enjoy the rides and this time of year the queues are quite short. I think 30mins was our longest queue but most were only 5 10mins. I recommend sticking around after the parade and riding a few more rides. Don't leave right then as half the park does, so transportation must be hell then. We left 40mins later and it was a breeze (ps  ride the runaway cars in the dark!) I also recommend downloading the HK Disney app. It gives you a map and the wait time of all rides in real time. Food: We did eat burgers at the park. While expensive I would say it was average price for an amusement park. Both ours were tasty. We also got popcorn for the parade and that was really good! Transportation: don't waste your money on cab fees to get here. It's quite manageable on the subway, just ask your hotel concierge and they'll direct you. Besides hopping on the Disney line to get there starts the magical experience. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"537868290,3,2017-11,Australia,""I went to Disneyland to ride in the Teacups, but they were undergoing renovation   so the sign said. Many of the restaurants were closed. The Fantasy Garden where you can usually have photos taken with all the characters was also closed. The sign said Mickey and Friends would be at The Main Street entrance for photos. Later in the day when we tried to join the line at the Main Street entrance for photos with Mickey we were told that there were enough people already so we were turned away. The line was not extensive or long by an means. The Omnibus Street vehicle was out of service. When we went to Disney's Storybook Theatre to see the 4.30 Mickey Show there was an employee holding a sign saying this show is full. I think that if you are paying $100AUD you should expect that EVERY attraction would be open and operational.A tip   buy your ticket online from the Disneyland website. You will not have to line up at the ticket booth and you will save some time. If you are a visitor to Hong Kong you will also receive a $50HK shopping voucher."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Some queuing but wasn't too long but would not go on a public holiday or special event day. Check their calendar online. Lots of teens there but plenty of rides and attractions geared towards younger children as well..which suited us. Worth catching the parade.

We were only able to ride 4 rides for a whole day because of the lines being extremely long!

"537558495,4,2017-11,Sweden,""Having visited both the Disney parks in both Orlando and Los Angeles I would judge this one as on the smaller side. Apart from that it's a Disneyland with all the magic you would expect.Extra marks for the train that immerses you into the Disney magic even before you arrive.A few things that we noted that could be better though:* On our visit several restaurants were closed. We had to search quite long for restaurants that were not waaay to expensive. In my mind, eating at a Disney park doesn't have the purpose of eating high class food, it's just about filling up energy quickly to get back into the park. If you need to close restaurants, please keep more of the lower priced ones open.* A little too much Chinese for an international park. For example, our 4 year old attended the Jedi academy and it was spoken a lot in chinese. Now, he doesn't understand English either, but if it was in English we could have helped him better. Perhaps more separate events in Chinese and English?* Opening hours 10:30 to 20:00 is too short. I don't know why they chose to open so late and close so early, but isn't most Disney parks in the US open until about midnight?"",Disneyland_HongKong"

I went on a weekday and almost all the rides had a waiting time of less than 5minutes. 2. Was disappointed to discover that the Buzz Lightyear ride was decommissioned. However, my absolute favorite is still Mystic Manor. 3. Food is expensive, but still reasonable. 4. There are water fountains at some designated spots, so you can fill your bottles there. 5. This was my second time visiting Disneyland HK, so 1 day is enough. Highly recommend first timer to get the 2 days pass so you can enjoy the park at a leisurely pace. 6. Currently under Halloween theme, and i didnt like the Halloween parades (both the afternoon and evening sessions) as much as the usual one.

"537139313,3,2017-10,Philippines,""My 4 grandchildren who had no experience of the LA and Orlando Disney had relative fun spending a whole day in the HK Disney. They .spent most of their time in the rides since Disney characters were wanting to seek autographs from and pose for pictures. They were only able to get Mickey and Minnie's autographs and pictures after a sweltering 2 hour queue, Chip and Dale and a picture with Goofy who luckily was roaming the Main Street. As a Halloween treat, there were two (2) short parades added: Mickey's Halloween Time Street Party and Villains Night Out! Chapter Two. However, these couldn't compare with the pomp and glamour in the parades at LA, more so at Orlando. The place was small, the rides and the fireworks even, leave much to be desired too. At any rate, since my grandchildren did not have anything to compare their experience with, they were moderately contented, clamoring for more rides hopefully in the future."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"537126079,3,2017-10,Vietnam,""It was school holidays, my brother lives in Hong Kong, and I had a 9 year old that wanted to go to DisneyLand.We had a couple of days visiting my brother, and then 2 days at the Park, overnighting at the Disney Explorer's Lodge. One advantage of the Lodge is that they have a shuttle bus to and from the Park, running every 15 minutes or so. That saved time (and money) getting to and from the Park.Firstly, I was surprised at how small Disneyland was, especially compared with what I remembered of my first (and last) visit to Disneyland in Anaheim in 1985! After getting through the turnstyles, we jumped on the Disneyland train that took us around the perimeter and deposited us at the back end of Fantasyland. It was quite quiet (we arrived around 2pm) and access to the rides was not lengthy. We jumped on Dumbo, which was suitable for small kids, and then went to Mickey's Phiharmajic. That was really great, a 3D movie themed around the Mickey Mouse song, played by an animated orchestra. Featuring Donald Duck (not Trump) as the conductor. At the end of the performance Donald went flying through the air and ended up going through the back wall!We wandered across to the Mad Hatter Tea Cup and spun ourselves silly, and then had a rest and an ice cream. We caught up with some friends around 4pm, and went straight to the Iron Man show. This one was a 4D movie, and was well worth the entry fee. We were in a type of flying fighting machine, which rocked and rolled, and was based in Stark Tower, nominally in Hong Kong. A great way of seeing the skyline, being destroyed by some  bad guys . We then wandered off to Adventureland, which was the highlight, especially the Grizzly Gulch roller coaster. Can't give too much away because I don't want to spoil the fun for others, but it was great. Dusk was falling, which added to the ambience when we went on the Jungle River Cruise. Fake crocs, elephants, hippos, and natives made a lot of noise, and it was quite eery.We ended the day with dinner in the Corner Cafe, where our little girls had some spaghetti, and the men had a pair of Rueben sandwiches. Surprisingly good. Which brings me to the disappointing part of Disneyland. As said at the start, as a themed, fun park, carrying the Disney name, I would have thought it would be better. However, the main emphasis seems to be selling: average and expensive food, and poor quality Disney products. Clothes, dolls, stuffed animals, and other Disney memorabilia. It became a bit much where around every corner there was a food shop, or a retail store. In fact Main Street had one side of it filled with retail. I was fortunate that my daughter was well disciplined, and we only ended up was an umbrella, and a Mickey Spatula, to assist with her baking! Not so lucky were a lot of other parents who were weighed down with lots of  stuff .Overall, the theme park was good, and the nightly fireworks were great. However, it all paled into insignificance compared to the retail and the food."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"536779003,4,2017-10,Canada,""We visited on a Saturday at around 130pm and stayed till 10pm. Buy tickets ahead of time to skip the ticket line. It was busy as expected and line for rides were at least 40 minutes. Food and drinks were expensive like any theme park ($28 32 HKD for bottled drinks and $30ish HKD for corn hot dog ice cream, etc). Snacks stalls do shut down in the evening. There are restaurants that remains open. Evening is the best, as the temperature is cooler and after 6pm or so, we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to as the wait times were anywhere from 0 to 20 minutes, except the night time stuff and kids rides in Fantasyland   lots of kids even at night! The rafts to the treehouse closes in the evening, but do go around 5 6pm to avoid standing in line. Part of Toy Story Land was also blocked off when we got there around 7pm ish. We saw fireworks at 8pm and parade at around 9pm. I've only been to Disney World in Florida. So, in comparison, this Disneyland is much more manageable as a day half day trip. It was a fun visit for us. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"536763852,3,2017-8,India,""Ever since we visited the park in Los Angeles, my daughter was keen to visit the one again and we decided to take her to Hong Kong. We were extremely enthusiastic about this place and bought 2 days ticket but we couldnt even spend one full day here. This place is nowhere close to the one in US and is extremely commercial. What I mean by commercial is that the focus is more on shops rather than characters and their house, the disney experience etc. The entrance is designed similar to the one in Los Angeles. There are some rides but those are not the one that one goes to disneyland for. There is a toy train that gives a good ride across the park. However, if you are expecting to meet all the characters then you would surely be disappointed as there are only mickey and mini and they also stand in a shaded area rather than having a home of their own. Plus there arent other characters and princess castle etc. There is a food court and some eateries inside and you can also buy waterbottles etc. so dont worry about carrying food, drinks etc. In summary, what you get is all the toys  figurines etc but the place fails to offer the disney experience. Maybe Disney undermined the tourism potential of Asia and developed a very small park that focuses more on shops rather than Disney experience. After some time it felt as if we are in Disney mall rather than Disneyland. If you havent been to any disneyland then its a fine place to go to. However, if you want a real disney experience, I would suggest visiting the one the Los Angeles (if and when you plan a trip to US). You can separately view my review of the the Disneyland in US.Overall, I was indeed disappointed and its possible that this disappointment was because of my prior visit to the one in US. If you plan to visit, please do keep maximum of a day for it and do carry umbrellas (as it gets really hot in summer) and a camera."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"536732213,4,2017-10,Australia,""Our recent trip to Hong Kong was another testing the user friendly nature of holiday destinations for people in wheelchairs. And, I am pleased to say that Disneyland Hong Kong really did step up to the mark. On entry the staff (cast members they call themselves) pay attention to those in wheelchairs to make it easier to enter. Security and bag checks on entry provide a higher sense of safety in these troubled times. And, don't forget that when you go through the gate ask for the multiple entry stamp so that if you leave during the day you can come back again on the same day without the cost of another ticket. Also if you decide to come back for a second day it is cheaper to upgrade your one day pass to a two or multi day pass at the gate than to buy another ticket. Like all theme parks Disney land is not cheap, food is of poor quality and very expensive, drinks including bottled water are also very expensive. However, they do have rides that cater for people in wheelchairs. In all our travels we have not experienced this before. The park has a number of rides that have special carriages that allow the wheelchair to be loaded passenger and all onto the ride thus ensuring the whole family can enjoy the ride together. These rides are clearly marked on the theme park maps. Other good things about the park include abundant seating as there is a lot of walking to do and a lot of waiting for the young adults (Children) who are off on the roller coasters, etc. when mum and dad are worn out. The paths are easy to navigate even with the crowds and make the use of wheelchairs both manual and electric much easier. We went during the day and then came back at night to watch the fireworks. A tip here   they turn the lights out at night for the fireworks show which in the crush of people makes this a pick pockets paradise. Keep your valuables secure and wear your bag at the front. I had my back pockets touched a number of times during the show but fortunately had my RFID wallet in my front pocket on a chain secured to my belt. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and recommend the park as a good day out for the family. If you stay at one of the Disney resorts they are only a short shuttle bus ride or 15minute walk from the park.

So do plan how you want to use this facility. Bring your own water bottle to refill water.

They don't have the delicious and famous turkey legs!! In October several restaurants were closed. Something that was really shocking for Disney was people who work there did not speak English or spoke English very limited. Really a shame, In Paris, and the USA most of them are bilingual. Here you have one tip, if you are going to buy your tickets on line buy them with the 3 meal plan, you would pay 30 US dollars per person more but just one main dish for lunch is 20 US dollars, ( and you would get a snack, lunch( main dish plus soda) dinner (main dish with soda) and a discount for a beverage) so it definitely is worth it.

Majority don   t smile, they don   t greet, they are not willing to help you out even when asking for a simple direction, they shout, my 4 year old son even got scolded in front of me since he was holding on to one of the queue ropes, the worst part?  I was carrying my son because he got tired while waiting for the queue at the ironman ride, this young staff shouted at me and asked me to put him down!

We hardly understand their english, so we politely requested to repeat what they are saying, but as expected, the staff got pissed and shouted again.When asking for direction, they seemed to be not in the mood to assist as well.In the merchandise stores, don   t expect them to help you when you are buying a US$60 toy and (after paying) you want to try if the battery operated toy is working. I have been told that    it should work or just bring it back it if doesn   t   . The positive side: The park is clean, and there   s always an english translation in almost all the rides. Also, since we went there on a weekday (Monday & Tuesday, which I think is the best time to visit), there was hardly a queue on majority of the rides and attraction . The longest queue is around 20 minutes, while majority is 5 10 minutes thereabouts.I am not sure if our experience with their staff is culture related, but majority of the staff at Disney Hollywood Hotel, including the shuttle bus drivers were likewise rude. I will be sharing our experience at this hotel in a separate review.All in all, if you are used to the friendly ambiance in most Disneyland Resorts, you basically have to lower down your expectations when visiting Hongkong Disneyland. Disney Management should seriously look into this. I am not sure if the staff are compensated well, but they should be consistently reminded to be customer service oriented, because they definitely seem to be the most unhappiest, and unfriendliest staff."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"535719859,5,2017-8,India,""Amazing experience that we all had fantasies about. when you are  in  Disneyland, your are a child again and  that  is  the  best  way to  enjoy your  day.."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"535385151,3,2017-10,United States,""I wish I could give 3 1 2 stars because that would be more accurate. However, this is a hard review because there are some positives, but there are some big negatives to Hong Kong Disney.POSITIVESWait Times   If you go during the week and get there when the park opens (generally at 10:30 AM), you will have 10 minute waits or less for the first couple of hours in the park. We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day. We choose to ride our favorite rides 2 3 times and we still rode 80% of the rides at the park.Cast Members   I can't even believe I'm saying this about a Disney property, but the Cast Members were lacking...by a lot! Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more. It seemed accepted and even the cast members looked the other way (figuratively   because most were looking right at them and didn't do a thing). Again, this really took away from the experience. Nothing about the atmosphere at HK Disney seemed  Disney esque There are other minor items on both sides, but these are the major points of interest. Having been to 9 Disney parks around the world, this would definitely be at the bottom of the list.That being said, if you want to go and ride some terrific rides at a park that is not terribly crowded most of the time, then I would encourage you to go. Quite honestly, the little kids probably won't even notice. But the adults, they will notice that this park does not have the Disney mystique."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"535322332,5,2017-10,Malaysia,""What can I say? Its Disneyland! If you have not been to one, this might be THE ONE for you. Its probably the most affordable one.Its great fun, everyone smiles inside, the rides are fun, 3D 4D movies are WOW. Dont miss the end of day parade at 0700pm and the fireworks at 0800pm!

We were told that the park is quieter at this time of year as school holidays have ended. The variety and price of food was great. You must try a Mickey Waffle they are delicious! I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the park and amenities there was not a spot of rubbish. I would definitely visit again. Price and availability of souvenirs also excellent.,Disneyland_HongKong
"534787715,3,2017-5,Australia,""We love Disney parks but this one lacks so much appeal compared to USA parks. There is no atmosphere in the park, in parts it was like a deserted ghost town. It is smaller compared to the others which is not a problem but its just lacking in so many ways. The staff are not as friendly either.Some good rides there like your usual space mountain, buzz lightyear etc. Food and drinks are really expensive so be prepared. As a family we never had to really que for anything which was great. Sadly we did not see the parade as a huge storm came over the park. This did not detract from our day as we have seen parades before. Can't quite put my finger on it but we all agreed the park was missing the Disney sparkle."",Disneyland_HongKong"

The choice of food at restaurants is average but do try the mickey waffle with cream in his ears!!The worst bit for us was character meeting where the staff believe they are entitled to talk and behave with customers the way they like. We had first hand account of a couple begging to meet a character but they were turned down even though they'd come from abroad since they were five minutes late. We ourselves wanted to take our children to meet Donald but were slightly late since my wife stopped to help an elderly couple. I totally understand that being late is not an excuse and am not even arguing about it but the way the lady behaved and talked to us is at best appalling. We don't speak Chinese and she then started joking about us with other customers and they were all laughing. My family was very upset at this so I went to the guest relations team to lodge a formal complaint. The guy there took details of the incident on a small piece of paper and did not ask for my name contact. When I asked how they would send me feedback he said they don't but that he would raise it with the department of the employee concerned."",Disneyland_HongKong"

532829037,4,2017-10,Sweden,Being middle aged without any kids I probably am the wrong person to rate this since it is a fantasy land for kids. But there are still quite a few things for us adults as well. I liked the Star Wars themed Hyperspace Mountain is a really fast and cramped rollercoaster. Since it all is so fast I didn   t really get the Star Wars feeling I wanted. I really liked the Iron Man Experience. And the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars was a great rollercoaster. But what I really loved was the Mystic Manor. A great little thing that really draws you into the story. We went on the Monday after the Golden Week and didn   t need to use any of our Fast Passes. Great! We didn   t have a problem doing everything we wanted in a day.,Disneyland_HongKong

For seniors it is one of the best values in town HK$100 (which includes all rides and attraction) so make sure you have something to prove your age. The whole place is Disney    immaculate    and there are many rides and attractions and many many shop! At this stage of life, I forego the more adventurous rides and was more than satisfied with the    It   s a small world    wonderful    river cave    type boat ride gliding past animated representations of children from all over the world (did that twice), the Cinderella Carousel and the quite amazing Mystic Manor attraction.

It has much of the same magic and they do quite well at making the Disney experience memorable. Remember that there are some rides that aren't open all day. The parade was good. Night time was better. Everything is on a smaller scale. If this is your first park, you will love it, if you have done Anaheim, you will notice the difference. Unlike Shanghai they have Tinkerbell.

"532248608,3,2017-10,United States,""We were traveling to Hong Kong with our children and knew we needed to do a day at Hong Kong Disneyland. The park is rather small so a day is plenty of time. The lines to the rides were 10 minutes or less and the crowds were not overwhelming. Drawbacks, although it was Disney, I felt like it was Disney at 50% effort. It was Halloween and I have been to many other parks at this time and the decorations are amazing. Hong Kong Disney had Halloween decor up, but it seemed to be the leftovers from the other parks. It was not the same feeling you get in LA, or Orlando. I am glad we went, but definitely ok with going one time in my life. Side note, the weather was miserable.

You could take a taxi but the train completes the Disney experience here. You should take the train. One comes every 3 mins.While quite a bit smaller than Disney in Orlando, FL, this Disney packs a lot of great things in. It has tons of great rides for the small ones and everyone else, including tea cups and dumbo. There is also Space Mountain but it is Star Wars themed and SUPER cool!!! Our favourite ride by far!!! It's like being in the scenes of the death Star battle with Tie fighters and x wings zooming in every direction. Our 7yo son thought it was a bit loud and fast but this was the first rollercoaster he has ever been on.We all really enjoyed the jungle boat ride  our guide was very funny! Tarzana tree house was also a favourite.Get your pictures with Micky, Minie, Cinderella, and all the Star Wars characters too !!!!We went on a Wednesday at 11 and it was great bc it was not crowded and we waited only 5 mins to get on rides!!!! That's almost unheard of!!!!The castle is small but still cool to see. We didn't stay for the parade. It would have made for too long a day.

My suggestions specially during summer:  bring umbrella and your camera phone  bring a lot of water (expensive inside)  wear rubber shoes and comfortable clothings  bring face towel tissues wet & dry  try all the rides as much as you can  be a child again enjoy the ridesAnyway, my mom's 73 but still strong and healthy... she enjoyed that moment "",Disneyland_HongKong"

Autopia (also known as Tomorrowland Speedway) has been shut completely and I remember there was a roller coaster ride which is also gone. However, they've replaced it with Buzz Lightyear Space Mission, which is fun   its a 1v1 laser shooting game where to hit targets to gain points. I remember I was so good at it I scored over a million points (max level) HAHA.Space Mountain ride is a must go!!! It's the same as the one in Disney World!!! Loads of fast corners and humps!!!The rest is pretty much the same so nothing much to talk about.The only thing good is with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, you will hardly see any Mainland Chinese tourists in Hk Disneyland.

We received fast passes for every day plus daily priority entry to the first Storybook show (which was wonderful, albeit slightly weird with Goofy, Mickey and Olaf talking in Chinese, with songs being sung in English).Breakfast was plentiful, as was the evening food. The free wine and beer each evening was very welcome and relaxing after a day exploring or visiting the park. Having Mickey, Minnie or Daisy duck visit the lounge in their pyjamas each evening was quant and something I wish Disneyworld did. Both children and adults got into the swing of things and turned up in their PJs!Was able to explore the 2 other hotels, and if we wanted to could use their facilities. The only negative was a lack of a restaurant bar at the pool. Having to order room service which took an hour was not ideal. There was a jug of water by the pool   s entrance, but sometimes water will not do, so we ended up getting dried and dressed a few times and going to the lounge just to have a cup of tea. For some reason none of the 3 hotels appeared to have food facilities at the pool     something I have not encountered before.Tip     by the annual pass for the park     we did and got a good reduction in room prices, discount at park restaurants and on shopping     well worth the money and the tickets are dirt cheap compared the Disneyworld!Can   t wait to visit again, hopefully in a year or two."",Disneyland_HongKong"

We arrived on the train at about 10am for a 10:30am opening and we breezed straight through the bag checks and joined the lines to get in. They opened Main Street early for some shopping which was perfect as we had the chance to scope out some purchases for later in the day. Most of the park opened at 10:30 and we headed straight to Adventureland to ride Jungle Cruise. They have the option for several different languages which is great for visitors that don't speak English. We then waited a few minutes for Grizzly Gulch to open and headed for a few rides on that and then Mystic Manor. They had an interactive marvel attraction thing happening which was good. Without giving a full run down of the day we pretty much managed everything we wanted to go on and saw all the parades, fireworks and special Halloween happenings. The magic book show was brill. I think it's a bit disappointing that they cancel Paint the Night for Halloween as the Halloween parade was average in comparison. Tomorrowland is a little sad at the minute with all of the renovations but we loved the Iron Man experience, a nice evolution of star tours.

There was a separate line for in house guests and day visitors at the entrance. One day is enough if you plan to just roam around the park. But those who would like to ride all the rides and witness all the live shows cannot do it all in one day since the waiting time range from 20 60 minutes and there are a lot of great attractions inside the park. I highly suggest you wear your most comfortable footwear because you will be on your feet for hours.The live shows gave me chills because it brought back a lot of childhood memories. My salute and respect to all the talents!The food was a little bit pricey but its serving is big enough for a parent to share with a child. Our favorite restaurant was Explorer's Club. Water is quite expensive there so better bring a water bottle you can refill from water fountains near comfort rooms. Speaking of comfort rooms, every attraction has a CR with many cubicles and tissue papers. There are also defibrillators located near every comfort rooms. When visiting with children, the park has strollers for rent. And they have a station for lost children where you can report a missing child (heaven forbids!).

Theres no such queuing system, it doesnt matter that you have been waiting an hour, someone will come along, pretend someone else is ahead, get to a certain point and call the rest of the family friends to push in!! Because of the language barrier i got a lot of giggles, shaking of heads and just ignored when confronted them. It happened in pretty much every queue which ruined the whole experience. Also the park is small, theres no cooling system , perhaps more sheltered areas, AC, Fanned areas, even in the queue they could have them water spritzing things, the excessive heat made it uncomfortable. Theres not enough food options, not enough international, we ate at the corner cafe but had to wait 30 mins to be seated.

They had all the great rides that all the Disney parks have, other than pirates of the Caribbean and splash mountain. It was a bit disappointing not having a water ride in HK, considering how hot it is. Two things that disappointed us was that we really struggled to find vegetarian meals that were dairy free (allergies) and the merchandise wasn   t great. We didn   t buy any merchandise.

It was good quality tasty fresh food. It was served quickly and we really enjoyable. We queue for a food rides but the lines move quickly and loads are air conditioned waiting areas. We stayed on to see the Halloween parade   it was all in Chinese but the costumes and performers were excellent. The train ride back to Sunny Bay and the whole experience was enjoyable. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"530100654,4,2017-10,Australia,""Disneyland never fails to disappoint. HK Disney is really easy to get to by train and once you get off you feel like the magic begins. Go in the middle of the week if possible because it isn't as busy, the longest we waited for a ride was 30 minutes, and even though you wait it's still an experience. The best rides for adults and kids over 7 were Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly runaway minecars. When it comes to food I highly recommend taking snacks and water. With the water though you can fill them up at the water stations. We had dinner st the Corner Cafe which was ok given the standard of food at all Disney locations. 10 hours later, sore feet and tired kids but it's all worth it   it is the happiest place on earth!

We booked through Klook for discounted tickets and it was definitely a great choice. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"530048726,4,2017-10,Australia,""This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them.

Very less crowd and didn't have to wait more than 5mins for any rides or shows. Took popular rides even 2 3 times. Not the case during usual days where queues take 30 45mins for popular rides.

And this trait of those visiting Disneyland gets heightened even more. The rides have a minimum waiting time of 1 hour. Often it seems people don't even know why they were standing in a particular line. Just not worth the experience. If you just can't miss this, then at least go after 3 pm. Most rides are open till 8 and park is open till 10:30. Disappointing and just not worth it. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

528971701,5,2017-9,Australia,This is a fabulous destination that offers something for all ages and fitness levels. The older kids loved the big thrill rides.

Loved the atmosphere and the high standards of presentation throughout the park. Highly recommended.,Disneyland_HongKong

It is brilliantly done with props and big strong voices. If arriving by train, you will love Disney's own carriages, it is a fun way to arrive and kick start your day "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"528484653,3,2017-9,United States,""Maybe September is not a big month for Disney Hong Kong or maybe it was the weather, but several rides were not open. Our biggest disappointment was that Buzz Lightyear had closed the previous weekend forever. It will be rebranded as part of a new theme being developed in that area. The line at Buzz was always not too long (like Orlando) so we would ride it over and over again. I guess we're stuck with trying to get fast passes in Orlando in the future.The Lion King was very good with some changes improvements from the last time we visited. The only bad part is the wait to get in.Hong Kong Disney size wise is nothing like Orlando so if that is what you are expecting you will be disappointed greatly. It is worth at least one visit (we've been 3 times) just to do something other than go downtown with the crowds. We've never experienced the lines of Orlando so the wait time is much shorter and you can cover all the rides easily in a day. It's just not as  magic  as Orlando and everything is smaller   even the castle. It's a small world ride is as good as Orlando though."",Disneyland_HongKong"

Yes, it is truly magical as you will be seeing a lot of Disney characters you might have watched (and sometimes, your favorites)   from Princesses, to figure character and more! You will be able to meet your favorite Disney characters, watch live shows and parades, and shop and dine at all themed areas of the Hong Kong Disneyland park! HK Disneyland is accesible both via train, car and buses! Making it always on top of the lists whenever tourist planned going to Hongkong. HK Disneyland yet being so magical, is so HUGE that even (i think) a day pass would not be sufficient enough to pay a visit and enjoy everything it has to offer. They got a lot of attractions, interactive, inviting and most of all exciting.TIPS:1. Book your ticket in advance. Though getting ticket on the day itself would be fine, just to ensure you are able to manage potential hassle, I would highly suggest to book your tickets ahead. They got 1 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $70.00 to $75.00 and 2 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $90.00 to $97.00. These are e tickets that can be purchased online. Once redeemed your voucher for your physical ticket, you must enter Disneyland within 3 days. For 2 day tickets, your first entry must be within 3 days, the second within 7 days of the first visit. Child tickets will be sold to children within the age of 3 11.2. Check the weather. There are chances HK is in rainy season, so you might want to prepare your Rain Gears! If the weather is sunny, make sure you have sunscreen protection, sunglassed or umbrella. 3. Water is a must! You need to get a hand on a bottle water as surely you will be having loads of walk!4. HK Disneyland is so big and it is advisable to always refer to the maps provided on the entrance. As Disneyland also provides wi fi, might as well download their app (IOS and Android) for better schedules of attractions. better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 5. Between 2:30pm to 3:00pm (Local Time) they are hosting parade of colors which will give you a glimpse of the different disney colors.6. Between 6:00 to 6:30pm (Local Time) you will be able to witness Parade of Lights! I absolutely love this one   very stunning and spectacular.7.

I'm not saying that this park isn't fun, it's just a little bit fractured compared to other Disney parks. The lands while they exist aren't as harmonious as you might find at other parks. The difference at this park is the quality of some of their attractions. Mystic Manor is probably one of the best Disney rides ever built. Grizzly Gulch Mine Train is one of the best roller coasters on any Disney property. Best of all each one of these attractions is surrounded by a well themed land.The new Iron Man attractions are OK, but nothing worth the trip alone.

Because we went last week when most children were in school, we did not have to wait in line for any rides which was great. There are not a ton of rides at this park but what they did have we enjoyed and we were able to do the whole park in one day without rushing around. My particular favorite rides were the Star Wars themed hyper Space Mountain and the Mystic Manor ride.I understand that this is the smallest of the Disney parks and as adult I found it relaxing and fun. I am not 100% sure that older children would be as captivated but this park is really a great size for families with smaller children. With Disney having Marvel & Star Wars rides now  I think that teenagers will be into the Disney parks too and if Disneyland Hong Kong adds more of these type rides they will get the teenagers excited about Disneyland Hong Kong too.Food was decent, the walk in ticket price was good considering I spent the whole day exploring and riding rides. The firework show was quite lovely too. Also I managed to go on the first day of the Halloween themed parades and the Hong Kong Disney Haunted House  Maze of Madness: The Nightmare Experiment Continues.

We were lucky enough to be visiting during the Tsum Tsum Fun Fair 2017. You pay extra to participate in games where you get and can win exclusive Tsum Tsum. Staff get very excited when people win. It was fun just to have a go. During the 2 days we never waited more than 5 10 minutes for a ride and on most occasions walked straight onto the rides. Fast passes not needed at this time of year. Mystic Manor is a must do. The Lion King Show and Mickey and the magical book were also good. Pin trading is available around the park but didn't observe many people doing so. Halloween activities were also on while we were there. All free. The maze was fun but scary for little people but not in English. Halloween Villain parade was great fun.

"526298832,5,2017-9,United States,""My husband and I have visited all of the Disney parks with the exception of Shanghai. HK Disneyland is small compared to the other parks, but it has lots of surprises that make it a real gem. We visited HK Disneyland on a Wednesday. Compared to the other parks, it felt like we were the only ones there. We walked into almost every ride. We didn't bother with Fast Passes or our resort Priority Passes. Not sure if this is the norm, but it was nice. The park as a whole was very clean (as to be expected) and even in the stifling heat humidity the cast members and parade performers put on an impressive and enthusiastic show.I'm an avid fan of the Haunted Mansion. When I read about Mystic Manor, I was a little disappointed that it would not be the classic experience that I have grown to love. However, MM really blew us away. It was lighthearted and adorable. Albert is so cute. We ended up doing this attraction twice. Space Mountain seemed slower and less impressive than the other parks, but it was still fun. We walked right onto the ride, so that helped.I love Star Wars and was skeptical of the Iron Man Experience existing in place of Star Tours. Again, we walked right onto the ride, but the items they have on display in the queue seem like they would be interesting to examine and would help to pass the time if there were to be a line. The ride was fun and it excited into a ship full of Avengers merch. The Halloween decorations were cute of course. I was very impressed with Toy Story Land.

Download their app for better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 1 day pass is not enough to cover the entire park! Too many lands to explore! Standy sunscreen, cap, sunglasses, umbrella! Loads of walk too. Recommend you guys to stay till closing when they do their fireworks display at 8pm HK Time. Same day re entry into park allowed. Just keep your tickets and get your hand stamped! The only bad thing is the overpriced water stations! They should have water coolers around too! Standby loads of cash for water and merchandise!!

It was a nice place for kids and kids at heart. We might go back and bring along our children so we can enjoy the moment with them .

You can also skip the long ticketing queue. Disney experience will require a full day. As i have made my visit twice to HK Disney on different occasions, my advice is try to come during the cool winter season. Under 34deg weather, you will easily go  punctured  by afternoon. Do arrive at the time of opening if you want to maximise your coverage of rides and shows. Some form of strategy is required. Bring your water bottle and keep yourself hydrated.

Food was excellent for a theme park! Parade was fun, but too long to stand in the hot sun and heat. Hong Kong is very hot and humid. Our tour guide on the Jungle River Cruise was hilarious and made the ride fun. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars.

Even the Grizzly rollercoaster isn't really thrilling. Disney Hong Kong desperately needs some topattractions (Tower of Terror, Rock 'n Rollercoaster,...) The park misses the real  magic Disney feel  because of the lack of enough Disney (movie)themed rides. So no Cinderella, Snowwhite etc.Because of all this I find the ticketprice too high!On the other hand the park is really clean, the personnel are very friendly and the food is good!

The toy story land was not as interesting as the one I went in Tokyo. Also the were not many rides though it was a new section. Disney service staff was also not as friendly as previously.

Judging from other reviews, September must be an ideal time to visit. We literally walked onto every ride in the park with little to no waiting. Whilst there are not a huge number of rides in this park, it was the ideal amount for us to be able to feel like we were easily able to do everything that we wanted to without any stress and still make our flight out. I would strongly advise using the MTR system to get to Disneyland. It is quick and cost effective. A big plus is the Disney train line! We made the mistake of catching a taxi to Disneyland where it cost us 10x the amount and we got caught in heavy traffic. The MTR was a lot less stressful.The 3:30 parade was a lot of fun, even for adults! Mystic Manor was my favourite ride of the day.The downside was that a number of restaurants and 2 rides were closed and I think it would have been even more fun with children!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Transferred to 3rd train, pink one, and viola...Disneyland! Of course the train was almost full. But no worry, there is one every 5 minutes. We went on a saturday, and just from the train, I was sure that thousands would be enjoying the resort that day. We bought food before entering the gates, @70HKD each meal. Yummy! Just along the road getting inside. Lined up for inspection, and take note you're not allowed to bring meals, only snack is allowed inside. Starting from Moby Dick, picture taking starts. As soon as you enter the gates, you are greeted by Mickey Mouse on the lawn! No phone sticks are allowed! Start with Tomorrowland, then Adventure land, Toy Story, etc etc...One whole day is not enough. You go there with battery full, and end up with battery empty. At 7pm, the Paint the Night Parade will really awaken all energy hiding inside of you coupled with the Fireworks.

I'm not sure if it was the time of year (we went in June   and on a weekday) but the park wasn't that busy. We waited 25 mins max for probably 2 rides. The Big Grizzly Mountain mine car ride was brilliant, the queue was actually so short we were able to get off the ride and walk round to ride again and be almost straight on. We did the same with Space Mountain. We bought a ticket which included a meal at a restaurant, this was a good value and the food wasn't bad. Getting here is so simple.

Long lines for all the nice rides awaited us. Even to get a picture with the characters entailed a 30 min wait minimum. To get a lunch table, you had to dash to one when a table frees up so that you will not lose the table to another hungry group. Even then, we had fun. The weather was nice, no rains and not too cold. As we had a toddler with us, we spent a lot of time on the not so popular rides (or as my cousin would call them, wimpy rides, lol) and my daughter had so much fun. :) You can see the wonder in her eyes when she saw characters big and up close. We got fast passes for some of the rides and just waited them out sitting on some benches at the park. This is probably my third visit to this park and the first one with my daughter and husband with me.

"520641999,4,2017-9,Australia,""Good range of rides for all ages, only 2 real adult rides but still fun. Park is relatively small so easy enough to maximise in one day and highly recommend going when it's forecast to be cloudy or rain, it's usually sporadic and generally no queues. Recommend getting a meal voucher from Klook which is easy to use and reasonable value. You can bring your own bottle of water and refill at the park. Make the most of fastpass at the hyperspace mountain."",Disneyland_HongKong"

520557056,5,2017-8,Thailand,Very good place for family. But alittle hot. So umbrella needed. The food is great but pricy. Recommend to go on week day so the people are not so crowd. Easy to travel to by mte sunnybay station,Disneyland_HongKong
520392258,4,2017-8,Italy,We were 2 adults. Better to buy online the ticket to jump the queue at the box office. I think that one complete day is enough to visit the park and try almost all the attraction.,Disneyland_HongKong
520364951,4,2017-9,Philippines,Very good theme park. Ideal for the whole family. Very convenient transportation wise and very systematic. Though food inside the park is not really good and expensive. Kids will definitely enjoy the rides and the shows.,Disneyland_HongKong

519714528,5,2017-8,Egypt,We had a great day at disney hong kong . It is spacious but not crowded with rides and stages. The main street in California and the sleeping beauty castle is always busy in California but in Hong king it is only busy during the parade whichis also not as the California parade but still nice to see it . Rides has long queues but anuway worth waiting as disney rides are really great.kids enjoyed the stage live shows .the festival of lion king and mickey wonderous story book was both amazing and really the airconditined stages are teally great in the hot weather. The electric parade and fire works were nice . Shops have different stuff than California disney land .Meet and greet characters are not the same everyday and hardly you can find disney princesses.mickey and minnie are there almost all the time. It is great to visit hongkong disney park but donr put it in comparison with disneyland or WDW.,Disneyland_HongKong

"519418520,4,2017-8,Philippines,""The visit to Disneyland was the visit that was ruined by bad weather. Even though it was raining, we still went for the sake of our granddaughter. Most rides and shows were open. We enjoyed the Lion King show and lined up for photo ops with Mickey and Minnie and Donald and Daisy, ride the carousel, went inside Small World , ate at Plaza Inn and shopped for souvenirs. Too bad, the parade was cancelled due to bad weather. It would have been the highlight of our granddaughter's visit."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"519216571,4,2017-8,Botswana,""We managed to get great weather and enjoyed 6 great hours of Disney fun. The park has the traditional Disney atmosphere with lots of activities and stores to keep you busy. Activities for all ages from kids to teenagers   then again which adult doesn't turn into a kid when they see Mickey Mouse. You'll need stamina to walk and if it's a busy day, you'll need patience to wait in the lines. There are no traditional fast passes, look around as each popular ride has a unique fast pass method through vending machines. The food options are basic and can get very very busy at meal times. We waited for 30 mins at one location for a table and then ended up moving to another area of the park just to get a bite. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"519204268,5,2017-3,Australia,""We arrived at opening time and the line was long but orderly. We had a great time as a family in the park, I would expect this being Disney.

518856338,5,2017-8,Kenya,We loved the whole experience and the kids were over the moon to meet most of the characters. Quite full so go prepared for long waits but totally worth it. Stay till after 7 pm to see the night parade and at 9 for the fireworks show,Disneyland_HongKong

Seeing my daughter react to the characters and the shows made the entire trip worth it. Expect a lot of walking. Bring extra shirtS and water. Make use of the line passes that allow you to be in line without having to stand.If you must bring a baby stroller, pack 2 bags. One with your valuables and the other with non essentials. All rides and shows will require you to leave the cart outside, in a baby cart parking lot. Having separate bags will allow you to easily leave the other with the cart outside without having to sort out your things. All in all an awesome day. Was quite tired afterwards but we all had a ton of fun."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"518606864,5,2017-8,Australia,""Having been to Florida and California Disney World land this is smaller and lacks the memorabilia that the USA ones have on show and around the park, rides are the same, parade was great and the park is very well kept. Pricey for food and drink but so is every Disneyland, less shops and restaurants but enough for its size. Rides pretty much the same but lines not as long as USA. Transport to here via MTR and cab was very easy. Fireworks over the castle were awesome we would come back with our family "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"518561302,5,2017-8,United States,""We live in Florida and have been frequent visitors of Disney World there, originally with children and now with grandchildren. We were a little skeptical about the experience we would have at the smaller Disneyland Hong Kong, when we visited it last week, but we were most pleasantly surprised how they have been able to replicate the engaging  Magic  on somewhat smaller but equally entertaining scale. "",Disneyland_HongKong"
518400477,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,I came here expecting it to be rammed with people and even though there were a lot the park seemed to cope pretty well with the mass volume of visitors. We caught the MTR to Sunny Bay and then caught the train   this was quite magical as a Disney themed train takes you to the theme park. Trains were very frequent so no waiting around . Queues were not too bad I think the longest was 35 mins which is acceptable in summer holidays . With the busier rides we used a fast track ticket (note there is no extra cost!!) and returned in the given time slot . After 5pm the crowds eased off and rides were easy to get on. Park is very easy to manoeuvre around   not too far to walk from one area to another. All very child friendly the staff very good and helpful   lots speaking very good English too. Top attraction for me was Hyperspace mountain   the children loved the Buzz Light year ride. Also enjoyed the Mystic mansion   great animation here. Watched the Lion King show   wow fantastic my daughter absolutely loved this . We stayed to watch the Night Parade   this was incredible ! Very pretty to see the floats all illuminated . Great Iron man ride if you don't get motion sickness   there was no queue here we went straight on . Food   you can't take your own food in and they do check your bags at the gate. Park food is expensive that is the downside   be prepared to part with money to buy the Disney brand . There are lots of outlets to eat from   food is  ok  standard . If you are feeling flush I can highly recommend a Disney themed ice cream   they were delicious but $45 a go ! So remember when its busy you can scan you entrance ticket in the fast track machine by the popular rides to get a slot time to return with no queue   there is a list of rides that have this feature on their web site. Great day out at Disney and they give you a nice fireworks display to close off your evening !,Disneyland_HongKong

Staff polite and well trained room ok was priced highet than 5 star top hotels....not sure it was any better than the Hollywood where we stayed last year.,Disneyland_HongKong
"517379789,2,2017-8,Canada,""Was quite disappointed with the park and should have done some research. We were mostly disappointed about the small size of the park and lack of rides compared to its North American and even EuroDisney counterparts. It's quite far from HK but easy to get to by MTR although you will need to transfer a couple of time. It doesn't need more than 1 day to get through it. We bought 2 day tickets but actually did not regret it as the heat in August is oppressive and we could only stay for a few hours at a time. Favourite rides were the Grizzly Gulch train and Mystic Manor (as it was air conditioned). Hyperspace mountain was OK   Star Wars themed now but pretty tame coaster compared to the updated Space Mountains in other parks. Meet and greet with the Star Wars characters was also a highlight though. On the 2nd day, it rained a little and all the outdoor rides closed. Also all the food vendors shut down as well. Can't imagine what we would have done if we bought the food voucher. If you've been to other Disney parks, prepare to be disappointed. If this is your first time to Disney, you get a taste of what the original is like so you will likely have much more fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

"516691508,5,2017-6,Philippines,""It is smaller than Tokyo Disneyland, but getting a 2 day pass is still a must. Everything about Hongkong Disneyland was fun for our family. The staff were nice (they can speak english relatively fluently), the rides were fun, the shows and parades were great and the food was superb.The only cons about Hong Kong Disneyland is the price (but typical of any theme park).Tips:1. GET A 2 DAY PASS (so you can see all the shows and try out all the rides).2. Be there at rope drop (10:30am) in order to enjoy the entire day in HK Disneyland (the staff and photographers are happier and more energetic in the morning).3. Tell your kids to get stickers from ANY ALL staff member s early in the day (by late afternoon, they run out of stickers).4. If you will get the photopass, don't forget to ask the staff with cameras that are roaming around to take your picture (the day pass is worth it if you maximize the roaming photographers). And don't forget to have the staff at each ride (where your photos are taken. I.e. Hyperspace mountain) scan your photopass card to save your photo.5. AVOID the souvenir shops (unless you really want to buy a souvenir or two), these will take a lot of your time especially if you are with kids.6. Check out klook.com and the hk disneyland website for promo day passes and 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 meal coupons (these coupons are cheaper compared to buying food ala carte). Compare the prices on the websites before purchasing.7. Plan your day ahead. Look at the map and schedules available on the HK disneyland app or website.8. Try to watch both the afternoon parade and the night parade (around 8pm).9. ENJOY YOUR DAY!P.S. the staff strickly enforce the  no outside food policy . But they are lenient with water bottles and baby formula. Bring a water bottle or two (Bottled water is expensive inside the theme park. There are drinking fountains around the theme park and HK tap water is potable, but you can taste the chlorine.)"",Disneyland_HongKong"

We walked around the whole thing in a matter of a couple hours. The rides aren't the greatest, but there are some fun ones to hit, especially Mystic Manor! The Tarzan area was closed when we visited, so sadly we did not get to explore that.

The parades were great and viewing easy if there 15 20 mins early. Free water fountains by toilet areas but we bought bottled, about 12 70ml over the day (4 of us sharing) as sooooo humid and hot.

"515370092,5,2017-8,United States,""After having visited Shanghai Disneyland a few days prior (it was just  meh ), Hong Kong Disneyland was a welcome respite! Lines were short, fast passes were readily available (though unnecessary), facilities (Park and Explorer's Lodge Hotel) were immaculate, and Cast Members exuded the Disney magic! Our longest wait time of the day was 20 minutes for RC Racer. We did Hyper Space Mountain, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly Gulch multiple times. We Fastpassed Winnie the Pooh, just for the sake of doing a Fastpass, but it really wasn't necessary as the hotel had given us 6 priority access passes. We only used 4 of the priority passes throughout the day. Lines were orderly and the Park was very clean. The food offerings at the Park were quite good too! We tried for the Mango Dole Whip at Jessie's Snack Roundup, but they didn't seem to carry it any longer. Instead we had the pineapple smoothie with ice cream and a churro on the side. Both were very good! We ate at the Starliner Diner for lunch, it's typical Disney quick service.We took a cab from HKG to Explorer's Lodge, but took the MTR back into the city after our Disney visit. The cab was around 145 HKD, while the MTR to the city was around 60 HKD (2 adults and one child).Like most Disney Parks (except Shanghai Disney), we were truly sad to leave Hong Kong Disneyland, and hope to be back soon!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Rides, shows, meet and greet session with Disney characters, a parade of Disney stars, and an impressive fire works display to cap off the day just to name a few. Just like the Hong Kong Ocean Park, I personally wish that the shows were done in English rather than Cantonese.

The crowds are mostly from mainland China, and most of them would probably try to jump queue, if not they'd stand really close behind you whilst you're waiting in line for no apparent reason.Even if you're not participating in any of the rides, make sure to prepare yourself with an umbrella, hat, water and sunscreen.

"513976199,4,2017-8,Hong Kong,""We have visited many theme parks all over the world and Hong Kong Disneyland was one of the top 5 in our list. Getting to Disneyland was easy and the rides were also pretty great. You can get a fast pass for some of the rides where there is a long wait or you could go for other rides in the meantime. The only downside for this was that, it was not available for all the rides and you had to wait for it no matter what, which was frustrating and tiring. The universal studios in Singapore had a better system where you could get an express pass by paying extra and skip the ques and save on a good 2 3 hours. The weather is also known to change pretty quick so remember to get an umbrella. The cost for the tickets was around 600 HKD pp and it was cheaper to buy the tickets at the airport. Remember to get your own bottled water as water was very expensive in the Disneyland.

Try to get there as soon as doors open (before 10.30) as locals don't appear to get out before 11 12 so there were practically no queues and it just got busier and busier the later it got.There is only really 3 rides and these are not big so it is definitely not a park for thrill seekers.The parade and musicals were amazing but they get full fast so make sure you queue up early!Drinks are about 3hk dollars and main food meals from 10hk dollars and up so relatively good prices for a park like this!Overall would recommend!"",Disneyland_HongKong"

The Fantasyland is the best, next is the Tomorrowland and the Magical shows. Inside Disneyland, there are good enough restaurants, food prices are of course high. Comfort rooms are airconditioned, so that as you go around, you will find comfort in their comfort rooms. The only thing that is a drawback was the comfort rooms were not consistently attended to by janitors because most of these smelled of urine. It was a Tuesday when we went there, expectedly there were not too many people but alas, there were a lot of guests. Nevertheless, I'm giving two thumb up to this place. The Parade of Lights and Firecrackers show were worth the wait and the visit. Never miss these events happening at 9:15 PM everyday."",Disneyland_HongKong"

"512395501,4,2017-7,United States,""Went to Shanghai Disneyland what a big difference when we went to Hong Kong Disneyland. It's like night and day!! Less crowded the people are not rude, no cutting lines everyone waits their turn. Really enjoyed seeing the Tarzan play it highlighted the Chinese acrobatic talent. That was probably my favorite show at Disneyland. Because it is not crowded we were able to see and cover more of the park in less hours. We only had time for about half day   4 hours and it was plenty enough time to cover what we wanted to see and do. All in all this is a pleasant experience and worth going to visit despite everyone saying it's so small and not worth it. Believe it I enjoyed myself here more than Shanghai Disneyland. Thumbs up for Hong Kong Disneyland and the people have more class here and wait patienty their turn."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"512301358,4,2016-11,Italy,""The children had a lot of fun at this HK park, waiting time for the attractions was not too long (surely we did not go in the peak season).  Average food quality, fast food type, as in all Disneyland locations tough."",Disneyland_HongKong"

512072548,3,2017-8,Italy,The park is limited with its restaurants and outlets you can't even get a bottle of water without waiting in line !! And shouldn't water be free ...? The rides are outdated and old style compared to other theme parks ... the worst was the Spider Man adventure !! You wait in line cooking for an hour just to be shuttled into a closed 2 x 2 room with a Chinese guy dressed in a Spider Man suit who only speaks Chinese and asks if you want a photo and that's it!! Seriously ?? Disney you are off my list ...hands down worst ever ,Disneyland_HongKong
511993586,5,2016-9,Philippines,Disneyland will really make you go back to ur childhood days. It was awesome to see Snow White and Mickey Mouse. It will make u proud as well to see Filipinos performing in the parade. Just that the price of the food inside the park are not reasonable.,Disneyland_HongKong
"511886399,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,""After been to Orlando last year guess hard to try compare , its small just 1 park , about half size of Paris , ideal for children under 8 , apart from the thunder mountain ride rest were tame , the boat trip was ok and we liked the haunted house but rest was mainly young kids rides , this definitely needs some new rides , there was no interactive rides , could be improved loads . It was easy to get to from our hotel in Kowloon about 10 15 mins to the disney stop then change to Disney train 1 stop "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"511704207,5,2017-8,United States,""We visited Hong Kong Disneyland and it was just an amazing time. The park is smaller than those in Paris and Tokyo however, it was still in line with the wonderful Disney experience. The park also has loads of special offers and special discounts that you can find by signing up on their free Wifi service and staff members handing out coupons. The only downside was that we purchased a dining plan and although the  fine print  says that you can use it for ice pops at carts around the park, management failed to provide the staff at the cards with the equipment necessary to process the QR coded vouchers."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"511601732,2,2017-8,New Zealand,""This was my first visit to ANY Disneyland. We arrived at 10am on a Thursday morning. I expected to see larger than life characters casually walking around. I thought I'd see a HUGE Disney castle and watch my kids faces explode with excitement. I thought I'd find some healthy food options.....Alas, none of those thugs happened for us. I thought the staff would be super happy and friendly (like the Disney adverts!) but only the cleaners were. The retail staff were totally vacant!I appreciated the  fast pass  system, but wish that had been extended to other rides so our under 5yr olds didn't have to queue 30mins for a 2min ride on a teacup. The best time of day for us was the last 30mins before the park closed whilst everyone was waiting for the parade and the queues cleared. Bliss. I can't say I'll go back. Maybe staying in a hotel on site it would be better.I just left thinking we should have saved the first Disneyland for a trip to the USA...."",Disneyland_HongKong"
511210445,4,2017-8,Greece,Our 3rd time to HK Disneyland as an older couple. Love seeing the young people enjoying themselves. Very humid and several showers of rain. Our food at the Explorers Club Restaurant was very average and overpriced. All merchandise is too dear. Staff well trained and very polite. $28 for a bottle of water.,Disneyland_HongKong
"510837104,3,2017-4,United Kingdom,""We really enjoyed Hong Kong Disney, however a few of the food outlets were closed. There was next to nothing for vegetarians or vegans. With so many of the food places not being open it made the queues worse. I think if your paying full price everything should be open. It was difficult to meet the characters, unlike when I went Florida and they were about everywhere. "",Disneyland_HongKong"

It's a long day if you stay for the 9pm fireworks display and you should, it won't disappoint...Plenty of food outlets and I mean plenty, merchandise stores also. All in all a slick well run operation...Disney does it right after decades of experience you'd expect nothing less from the moment you step on the Disney train with the Mickey Mouse ears...One worthy note, the fast track tickets are only valid at specific times for rides and attractions. You may arrive at an attraction only to find a sign saying come back in an hour...as with most places in HK if you visit at the W E or public holiday, there's gonna be long queues. Try to visit midweek..."",Disneyland_HongKong"

But, HK Disney is still Disneyland : ) My only comment would have to be that some of the shows were in Chinese, because it is in HK! but they could have considered that there are many foreigners too who would have loved Mickey Mouse to speak in English not in Mandarin (?). But all in all, still loved Disneyland!!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
510252803,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,I love Disney parks so when I was in Hong Kong found it necessary to visit. However I was underwhelmed compared with other parks I have visited. I felt like it lacked atmosphere and didn't have as many rides as I would have expected. Food outlets were limited and I wouldn't recommend the western food. The staff were friendly. This is the only Disney park I haven't felt the  magic  and probably wouldn't return there. ,Disneyland_HongKong
"509864743,5,2017-8,United States,""Came to Hong Kong to see Disneyland. Although it is not as large as the parks in America, we had a wonderful time. The day started with monsoon like rain that cooled off the weather for a while. We were able to see ride all the attractions without the outrageous lines in the USA. The Lion King and Mickeys Wonderous Book had exceptional live performers, especially Elsa. She sounded just like the movie"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"509863604,1,2017-8,United States,""Embarrassed for Mr. Walt Disney. The park was created in 2005. Disney had a blank slate to create a world class park. Instead they created an embarrassing tourist trap, that offered an uninspiring place to capture your money only. If Walt was alive he would have fired the person in charge of new park development.... Don't waste your time and don't waste your money at this park. No wonder The Hong Kong park is losing millions of $$ each year..now they have finally decided to invest big money staring in 2019 to rehab this place.. we live in Los Angeles and have been to Disneyland many many times..and are very proud of the park..but HK big joke"",Disneyland_HongKong"

Full marks for the ease of getting there using MTR and the special connection.We went on a Friday and it was quite comfortable. I imagine at a weekend during school holidays it will get very crowded, but we were able to get on all the things we wanted to without big queues.One or Two day passes are on sale. I cannot see how it could take more than one day to do everything, even with children in tow. In all a very pleasant day out."",Disneyland_HongKong"
509570313,5,2017-6,Australia,We had a absolute amazing time here and I highly recommend it for young families. To get the full feel of the park I would suggest two days so kids can have a couple turns on the rides. We did a morning to early afternoon for the first day and then a late afternoon till the end of night fireworks the second day and it was well worth it. International travellers should definitely take advantage staying at one of the 3 resorts which offer free shuttles all day long.,Disneyland_HongKong
509538714,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,Another great attraction in Hong Kong to visit especially if you have children      it's so simple to get there independently also on the mtr you just need to change once onto the special Disney train as you can imagine there is loads to do,Disneyland_HongKong

We went in holiday period of China was crazy busy and certainly no manners with some tourists alot of cutting and pushing..can do it all in one day...staff friendly and helpful...very hot in the park...if like us your children are tall take a copy of their passport we were spoken to so rudely because our children aged 11 and 9 are extremely tall they accused us of lying about their ages (was a bit of a dampener at the beginning)..The parades are great and the fireworks amazing...,Disneyland_HongKong

509157718,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,Went with our 10yr old on what we hoped would not be a rainy day. It is a nice park and easy to get round. We went mid week so the queues for the rides were quite small and there was enough variety to keep her interest. We arrived about 1 2hr after it opened and we had about 4 1 2hrs before it started to rain. A few of the rides were kept open and only lightening made them stop completely. We stayed till the end anyway and saw the fireworks but the parade was cancelled. If you get there when it opens & stay the full day I don't think you need more than a day to get round but if it's busy and you have young children 2 days might be better.,Disneyland_HongKong

Although the rides do not have the same thrill and excitement level as compared to Ocean Park, HK Disneyland well makes up for it in other ways bringing out your inner child with the familiarity of the Disney franchises. We really love some of the rides like the big grizzly mountain runaway mine, RC car, Disney express, mystic manor and it's a small world. Not to mention the parade and firework finale which was both the highlight of our visit at the theme park.Compliments also to the staff for the efficient crowd control during the fireworks.

Put my bags in their holding area (at a charge) then walked further down to the entry area and lined up for an hour to get in. Every ride had a sign saying 70 or 80 minute wait. Saw a hot dog at a vendor, the only thing in the whole park I liked to eat and after lining up for 40 mins, when I asked fir one they say  sold out, sorry I walked around in the hot hot sun in and out of all the people and then left.

508392418,4,2017-8,Australia,Amazing park perfect for young children maybe not so much young adults but as not many adult rides. My kids absolutely loved it from the rides to meeting their favorite characters. To be expected everything is expensive costing near $5 aud for water. But its a smaller very well maintained park with alot smaller wait times then the Anaheim park. Loved it. The only reason its 4 not 5 is prices.,Disneyland_HongKong
"508277314,4,2017-7,Netherlands,""Probably not the best idea to visit Disney when it's 36 degrees Celsius. But we enjoyed our day at the park. Not as much big roller coasters as in the other disneyparks. Lines were not too long, longest about 30 minutes. The new Marvel attractions are great.

The queues were too long and there were no princesses or charterers to be seen except at the end in the parade. The staff were not very cheerful and people pushed in all the time in the lines. They should have a priority queue for people with young kids as it seems unfair that all these adults are taking up the queue space while kids have to stand exhausted in the lines. Also the Disney characters were nowhere to be seen. Standing in queues with small children for a 5 minute ride is not that fun! Still my daughter enjoyed it!

"507454812,4,2017-1,Thailand,""We went just after they open the Iron man ride. Kids loved it! we even went twice. A good tip is to go during the week day, and avoid the national holiday, and school holiday, as it get very crowded. By going during the week, we barely wait more than 5 min per ride. Don't miss the new StarWars mountain, steeper, and faster than the Space mountains."",Disneyland_HongKong"

507148671,5,2016-8,India,We had full masti for the time we were in disneyland. We were dropped at the gate by our travel guide and had less than 12 hrs to explore it and make the best of it. The tips dat i cud quote which we used in this travel are1) we took out the complete map of disneyland and decided the approx time we wanted to spend in each area.2) although u wish to stay n breathe n njoy the surroundings but i promise u vl miss on alot of stuff so Rush!!3) u should not at all wear high heels or ne sort of uncomfortable boots or heels and must carry small racksacks (shoulder bags) for water n stff. Wear smthng cool n smart.4) we are pure vegetarians so by majboori we had no tym to waste on tryng food stfs5) enter ur first choice from right or left. It is tomorrowland or main street usa resp. I vl prfr tomorrowland cz u vl wsh fr sm small rides n nice views and then u cn follow the road.6) best part  spread.. we made our parents stand separately in queues of different rides so dat on njoyng one we cd run for another. Also one shd avoid rushy areas.. i.e. Dnt enter whr rush is entering. After sometime you will find it a lot easier space to njoy.DONT WASTE TYMDo njoy the night show. Dnt wrry abt takng d frst place near the boundary lines of the castle.. its fire crackers so focus on wats happng overhead,Disneyland_HongKong
506958560,5,2017-7,China,Hong Kong Disneyland is fantastic! It captures all of the traditional Disney elements whilst also putting it's own spin on things. The park is incredibly easy to navigate and well set out.Waits times are sooooooo much less here than at other Disneyland Resorts around the World. Definitely if you want short queues and be able to experience all that Disneyland has to offer then the best bet would be to make a trip to Hong Kong Disneyland you won't be disappointed!!,Disneyland_HongKong

"506337938,5,2017-5,Philippines,""Disneyland was indeed the happiest place I've been when I was in Hongkong. Although it was quite far from the place we were staying still, I enjoyed so much even from the start of the travel. They had their own Disney train where you can sit in a luxurious seat. The place was amazing. It would bring back childhood memories and it would cast away your worries. Parade of colors were nice. We actually witnessed two parades, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The fireworks were definitely wonderful. A place where there's no time to get bored. Definitely a happy place for family and friends... "",Disneyland_HongKong"
"506329203,3,2017-5,United States,""A one day pass for HK Disney cost us about $100 USD per person, which, for what you get, isn't really worth the cost. If you've already seen Disney World and or Disneyland in the US, HK Disney may disappoint you. Comparatively, it's very small. It's basically a tiny Magic Kingdom without many of the classic rides   no Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, etc.There are a couple of rides exclusive to HK Disney that are pretty neat. In particular, Mystic Manor is a very fun, smartly designed Haunted Mansion esque ride that I'd highly recommend.Disney fanatics might also want to check out some of the merchandise. There's more than enough of it, and much of it is exclusive to HK Disney.The food is much nicer fancier than the Disney parks food in the US, but it's also considerably more expensive.Getting there via the MTR was fairly easy, though it's a bit of a hike from Hong Kong Island or Kowloon. Getting back was a bit more difficult, since we left with the hordes of other people leaving right after the fireworks show that begins as the park closes. (The show was great, for what it's worth.)We went on a Tuesday, and there weren't many crowds or long lines. The park actually felt oddly empty. Then again, we were there on a holiday (Dragon Boat Festival), which may have kept a lot of people away, so take that with a grain of salt."",Disneyland_HongKong"

359113313,5,2016-3,Australia,This was a dream come true for our family. We totally loved every second. Lots of photo opportunities with characters. Rides were so much fun. The atmosphere was exactly what we expected for a Disney Park. The waiting lines can be quite long and other patrons can be quite pushy so keep that in mind and take lots if little breaks during the day. We had a 2 day pass and still didn't get to see everything. Highly recommend!!! Oh and make sure you see the Light the Night Parade at 7.30pm in Main St USA and the Fireworks show at 8.45pm over the Castle. Oh and if its your birthday make sure to go to City Hall in Main Street USA and get your birthday badge. If you decide to stay at a Disney Hotel and have a young daughter look into the Bibbity Bobbity Boutique princess experience that runs out of the Disneyland Hotel. You need to book though. If you stay at the Disneyland Hollywood Hotel like we did make sure to have a brekky or dinner at Chef Mickeys. LOVED IT!! ,Disneyland_HongKong
