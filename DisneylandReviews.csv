670772142,4,2019-4,Australia,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670682799,4,2019-5,Philippines,""Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman .. Changed by previous Buzz lightyear! More or less d same, but I'm expecting to have something most!!However, my boys like it!!Space Mountain .. Turns into Star Wars!! This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!!

But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670623270,4,2019-4,United Arab Emirates,""Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670607911,4,2019-4,Australia,""HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670607296,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,""the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670591897,3,2019-4,Singapore,""Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
670585330,5,2019-4,India,Great place! Your day will go by and you won't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670574142,3,2019-3,Malaysia,""Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670571027,2,2019-4,Australia,""Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670570869,5,2019-3,India,""I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
670443403,5,2019-4,United States,Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670435886,5,2019-4,Canada,""We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670376905,4,2019-4,Australia,""We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
670324965,5,2019-4,Philippines,It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670274554,5,2018-9,Australia,""This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670205135,3,2019-1,United Kingdom,""We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670199487,4,2019-4,Myanmar (Burma),""Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
670129921,3,2019-4,United Kingdom,Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesn't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
670099231,4,2019-4,Australia,It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
670033848,5,2018-11,Hong Kong,There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670030877,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,""We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"670022335,3,2019-4,United States,""First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience)."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
670007081,3,2019-4,United States,Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"669996858,3,2019-4,Singapore,""I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"669783708,5,2019-4,Australia,""GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
669548161,3,2019-4,Hong Kong,Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"669528186,3,2019-4,Australia,""This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
669403596,5,2018-12,Philippines,We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
669353396,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"669186152,3,2019-4,Australia,""I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"669093045,5,2019-4,Australia,""Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"669050447,4,2019-4,Australia,""A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"668819140,5,2019-4,Australia,""I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"668798543,5,2019-4,China,""This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"668777351,4,2018-12,Australia,""We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK don't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesn't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we didn't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
668611003,4,2019-4,Australia,Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"668374644,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,""If your are travelling to Disney land from mong cok you can purchase your tickets from one of the travel shops at a discounted rate (we purchased ours from Hong Thai travel) this is in the bank centre on Nathan road, right next to the Mong Kok station.   if you go to level 4 there are numerous travel shops (including CTS) which from other reviews that I read is where most people purchased the tickets. We asked around the shops on level 4 for the price of their Disneyland ticket (including CTS) and we found Hong Thai travel the cheapest. The tickets were $557HKD each for adults. I would recommend asking around each shop for their price on the day. They seem to all open at 10am. The sales advisor will hand you a letter which you then take to the box office at Disney land and swap for entry tickets   it was very easy and we had no problems. Hong Thai travel Bank centre Nathan roadAs the park opened at 10.30am we decided to get a taxi on the way there, this costs roughly $200HKD from Mong Kok and takes around 20 minutes.On the way back we used the trains, the route is:Disney land to Sunny Bay (pink line)Sunny Bay to Lai King Station (orange line)Lai King Station to Mong Kok (red line)The trains costs are around $20HKD and takes roughly 1 hour.  if you want to catch the train to Disneyland from Mong Kok the route is";"Mong Kok to Lai King Station (red line)Lai King Station to Sunny Bay Station (orange line)Sunny Bay Station to Disneyland (pink line)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
"668242919,4,2019-4,Australia,""Hong Kong is easy to get to via the MTR from Kowloon, great signage and fast. Our day started well but just after arriving it started to rain quite heavily and didn't stop until mid afternoon. Characters were out in the main street but only saw two during the day, probably due to the rain. Even though the crowds on entry were big once inside it didn't seem crowded at all, Toy Story Land was a ghost town with no one going on the rides in the rain. We enjoy the rides that were open and all in all had a good day. Had heard great things about Mystic Manor but found it just okay, loved Hyperspace Mountain, Ant Man and Ironman. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars were my favorite of the day! Though shopping wasn't as good as Disneyland in the USA which was disappointing, catering mainly to children. Happy to have visited but don't think I'd go to Hong Kong again."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
668209978,5,2018-9,Australia,You have to visit to understand the memorable experience. It is a place that brings out the child in everyone. You have to stay for the fireworks. Food is expensive so take snacks along.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"668111738,5,2018-6,Hong Kong,""HKDL got different event for different period. Like Jan Feb for Chines New Year, Apr May for Spring Carnival, then Summer, Halloween and Christmas, each event got different theme for both charaters costume and decorate, and sometimes might got the special daily parade too. Thats why recommend to check clearly which event you want to join before you make the disney trip. If you don't like crowded, Mar & November without any event happening will be your choice!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
667962395,3,2019-4,United States,The park is great if this is the only amusement park available to you. It is small and the rides are very tame. The park can be done in 3 4 of a day. Disney is always clean and has the best customer service.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"667949538,5,2019-4,Australia,""Visited here with the family and had a very memorable experience. It didn   t seem as big as Anaheim, but very clean and well maintained.  Received priority queuing passes but didn   t need them as the lines were very short."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"667897767,4,2019-3,Philippines,""It's always going to be fun at Disneyland. These are a few of my reminders: don't bring selfie sticks and huge tripods you can bring bottled water or if you have a reusable container, use that instead food can be expensive so eat plenty before going here. Just don't ride the rollercoasters right away. don't miss the Festival of the Lion King Show. You can forget the Moana production though if you're expecting the songs from the movie and to see Maui wear comfortable shoes. there will be lots of walking have fun and don't get discouraged by long queues. you'll have your turn sooner than you think."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"667633252,4,2019-2,United States,""To be honest it rained nearly all day, if the weather was better i'm sure my overall impression would have been much better. It lacks the thrill seeking rides of other disney parks. That being said it also lacked the ridiculously long quees. Waits were around 5 minutes! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"667600609,4,2018-10,United Kingdom,""A super small but cute Disney park   if you're a Disney fan you tick this park off in a day though, be warned, if you're used to the service in Walt Disney World and Disneyland, it doesn't seem to  translate  as well at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food is also not as good   we had lunch from the Lucky Nugget Saloon, which was mediocre at best.A fun day though, regardless."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"667509247,4,2019-4,United States,""Plaza Inn was fantastic, and the kids in our group loved the rides. It   s smaller than Disneyland, but if you love Disney, it   s worth the visit.

"667288224,5,2019-3,Australia,""We first did Disneyworld in Orlando some 40 yrs ago with our 2 year old.Back then, we had to buy different value tickets for various rides whereas that has changed and the entry fee now covers all rides etc, except for food. What hasn   t changed. The place is remarkably clean and well maintained given the number of visitors they see each day. Some rides had a long wait ie 40 minutes, so skipped them till later in the day ie 4 5pm, and the wait period was down to less than 10minutes.A very full day. We got there around 10.30 am and left when the street parade finished at around 9.15pm. Exhausting, but simply loved it "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"667095433,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,""Had a great time at Disneyland. Great, but can be busy on Saturday and Sunday. Only point to note, is that the park opens at 10:00 but the first zone does not open until 10:30. I purchased priority tickets, if going at the weekend I would recommend priority tickets.

I didn't visit the one in Paris when I went and I regret it. Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney Parks. We were able to ride all the rides in 3 hours when we first arrived at 9:30 a.m. I loved the Wondrous Book of Mickey and the Mystic Manor ride. I also liked the new Ant Man and Wasp ride b c it's like the Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger's ride in Orlando. I also liked how all the characters were dressed up for Easter and the Easter decorations they had up as well. I loved both parades, the afternoon and the night time one reminded me of the Electro Magic Parade that was in Orlando.

We bought tickets on sight with the additional VIP Status so that we didn't have to line up.It was a week day and the park was not full  it was heaven. My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Better check which amusements are under renovation as usually it has 1 or 2 parks under construction everyday.

665910063,4,2019-3,United States,My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"665245861,5,2019-4,Indonesia,""Who wouldn   t enjoy Disneyland? Hong Kong Disneyland is really easy to access. They have special metro to Disneyland and special designed. You better get there before 10 and directly queue until the parks open (at 10), so once it open you can enjoy many rides without long queue. Just be there on weekdays, avoid weekends!For muslim traveler, you shouldn   t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan   s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120 150 HKD if i   m not mistaken. I enjoy big rides but avoid big thrill drop. I   ve tried almost all rides except Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Shame, i   m afraid of fast backward drop lol.

"665132719,5,2019-4,Uganda,""We bought a package through the Disney website. We started at the Explorers lodge and the package included several priority passes (like fast passes). We actually never needed to use them because the longest wait time for a ride was 10 minutes. All of the shows and rides are in English and most cast members speak English really well. This park is the smallest of Disneyland parks in the world, but we still felt like there was enough to keep us busy for our day and a half that we were there.

"664668402,2,2019-4,Singapore,""I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again.

664665673,5,2019-4,Canada,We have been to LA and Florida Disney MANY times so we were told we would be disappointed with this one. Not at all! We loved it. It had different rides and shows while still having the same layout and Disney feel. It is expanding a whole lot at the moment. My suggestion would be to add more food restaurants as the food lines were as long as the ride liens. We purchased online tickets and bought a partial ride upgrade. We wanted the full ride upgrade but it was sold out for the day. IMHO it is well worth it! We spent opening to closing there and loved it. The midway games were fun,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"664378631,5,2019-4,India,""Everyone loves Disneyland !!! If you are traveling with young kids I would really recommend staying at one of the three Disney hotels. The hotels provide coaches, thereby making it more convinient. We stayed at the Disney hotel for two nights, the high point being the visit by the Disney characters at breakfast .  We also took a two day pass, it made the whole experience more relaxed and easy going.  Vegetarian food is only available at one of the restaurants. But the taste and quantity is good.  The park itself is well designed. There are enough options to engage very young kids to older kids.  The parade is not to be missed, as well as the different photo opps with all the Disney characters.  Other than the rides my kids really enjoyed the opportunity to dress up as young Jedi   s n fight the evil forces . A great family vacation. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is truly something for everyone of all ages. The lines where very well managed with even on opening day of the new marvel ride just around 40 mins wait. Make sure you use smart fast track passes where you can they are free at some rides.It   s fair to say this park is much smaller than the others but somehow in that it becomes so much more charming.The staff could not do more for people bending over backwards they clearly love their jobs. They just seemed to intuitively just know what people needed.Would strongly recommend anyone with a day or two to spare. The current two day ticket offer was great for us as we did most of the flagship rides day one and the show and on the second day the other items.With this very close proximity to the airport and cheap bag storage it   s an ideal place to stop over or visit on your last day like we did heading straight to the airport after.

664091514,5,2019-4,United States,Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. It is a smaller park but what it loses in size it makes up for in quality. Hong Kong is currently home to the only Marvel themed rides and they do not disappoint. Hong Kong has many of the standard rides shows you expect from Disney but it also maintains a variety of exclusives. Hong Kong also has a lot of exclusive merchandise especially pins. Also most if not all of the rides are Bilingual. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"663693003,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,""Buy your discounted tickets on Klook (thus no ticket queueing when you arrive), get the MTR to Disneyland (35 mins from Hong Kong station where we had breaky at the Pret A Manger in the shopping mall there.). Take in lots of water as it   s expensive in the park. We also took in kids food and snacks as they are expensive and not great quality, you get searched on entry by if you have a good bag with many compartments, it   s easy to hide! Get there at 1015am latest and when the gates open at 1030am go straight for the Star Wars or ToyStory area. Only 2 or 3 rides have the fast pass, if you want to go to the Winnie the Pooh, use it there as the queue was long. Toy story land was great and big queues for the green parachute ride, so that   s one to go to first if you don   t start with Star Wars. The 245pm street show was very good (no need to get there early) but we were disappointed not to see the lion king show that is not currently on (download the free Disney HK App   will tell you what   s happening when). The Lion King show is a not to miss apparently and you have to get there before the street show ends or you might not get in. Recommend the musical show in the big Theatre, that   s next to the Small world. Saw the 1230pm show with lots of singing and Mickey Mouse and goofy !Our highlight of the day though was Mine train  amazing.

We left the hotel at 8.30 am even though the park didn   t open until 10.30. I   m glad we did as it took a little while to get there and get tickets etc. We bought the Priority line pass for an extra HKD$299 but it was a big waste of money as the park wasn   t busy and we only had to wait once for a ride. As the park wasn   t busy there were many food shops that were not open. Our kids (13 and 10) loved the rides and went of a few of them several times. My 10 year old cried when we were leaving as she didn   t want to go   so she must of had a good day!

"662786512,4,2019-3,Malaysia,""Smallest Disneyland and spent a day here. Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats.

Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park.

"662592140,4,2019-4,United States,""We made it to Honk Kong Disney on the MTR and it was easy, quick and pretty convenient. We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online. I downloaded the app and it was great as a map and to track wait times for the rides. Most rides had 5 to 40 min waits. I recommend getting the fast pass for Dumbo as it was the only line that took MUCH longer than the advertised wait time. We were able to get on all the rides and still make it back on the MTR at a decent time but the train was pretty packed.

"662233037,5,2019-3,United Kingdom,""We tried to buy our tickets online the day before but after entering payment details it said try later. We tried with a different card and it still gave the same message. The credit card company said the payment was taken but we had not received a booking confirmation. We took a taxi from TST area and it was not expensive and in an air conditioned car it was a pleasant journey. We arrived about 10:30. The next day at the park we had to waste time at guest relations where we were told the payments had not been taken, so we bought our tickets at the park. We will need to check our card statements to ensure no payments have been taken!We did not know if we should add the priority pass to our tickets as there was no information on how long the queues were at the entrance, unlike parks we have visited in the US, so we purchased them.Whilst at The Iron Man ride the priority cards were scanned on entry then scanned again before getting on. This is where two of the priority rides were recorded as used but it should only have been recorded as once   we did not know this at the time. When we tried to use our priority pass for the 3rd time later we were told we had none left. This was very embarrassing in front of the other park Guests. We said it could have occurred at Iron Man as they scanned it twice and was told to go back to Iron Man! We were tired by this point from going around the park and did not want to walk back there and so said we would go to Guest Relations instead. Guest Relations were not apologetic. We were offered the priority ticket for our next visit but we are from the UK and do not expect to return! We were offered a soft drink or popcorn   whoopy dah! We had just had lunch   no thank you. So we left with it not being resolved to our satisfaction.Please be careful if you buy online and if you have purchased a priority pass!The queues were about 15 30 minutes.We did have a great time at Disney but the pre purchase and priority pass experiences have left us feeling dissatisfied rather than elated and we still need to check payments had not been taken, so our negative Disney experience continues, even once back in the UK for the next few weeks."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our day was no rain :) and it took only 5 minutes to get onto the rides we wanted. Wife had never done a disney trip before and got some good shots with the Characters. She thoroughly enjoyed the Main Street parade and when we left the train was 2 minutes walk which was easy to get to our hotel.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
662013836,5,2019-3,Malaysia,Spent 2 days in Disneyland with my young children. Our 2nd time actually to the park. A must visit to everybody if ever you have the opportunity !,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"661955342,3,2019-3,Australia,""We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasn't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so don't bother with a tour. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"661814158,5,2019-3,Philippines,""It is my second time coming to HK Disneyland. Unlucky us, it rained. Haha! Although rain didnt stop us from enjoying. Its just sad that the afternoon parade was cancelled. But during the night when the weather cleared, HK Disneyland pushed through the Paint the Night Parade. It was my first time seeing it. 6 years ago there was only fireworks behind the castle (which is now still under renovation).My family and I will definitely go back. Love seeing my little one enjoying Disneyland. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"661807684,4,2018-12,India,""HK disneyland was a great experience during Xmas, the celebrations and rides were great. People management was also top notch. Renovation of the main castle was undergoing when we went which was a disappointment so was the main night parade cancellation. We waited till the last moment but rains ruined it. Some refund or voucher would have been appreciated for cancelled show and castle renovation."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
661763501,5,2019-3,United States,The start of the journey to reach Disneyland by MTR gives a fun ride with the train painted with disney characters. There is also a train within the Disneyland which helps you reach some attractions.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"661666641,3,2019-2,Malaysia,""Visited this theme park on 26.02.19. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular. I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"661255238,5,2019-3,India,""I took my kids to Disneyland on weekday which was a great decision as there was minimum rush. very small queues. we reached there by 10 and started with Tomorrowland. we did all the rides by 5:30pm and left by 6:00 pm. Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons. We went to Royal Banquet hall for food. average food. carry water bottle as water is expensive there."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
660968080,4,2019-3,United States,We liked this compared with United States because its easier to navigate because its smaller and there are more rides for little ones. We went on Wed. and the line was short. Only from 5 minutes to 15 minutes wait. Unheard of in the USA. You can get here easily with MTR. Expect to spend a day here. They open at 10 am. The Moana show and the Disney Tale Story Show was our favorite.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660895571,5,2019-3,Hong Kong,""The monastery is really a beautiful place. The giant statues are truly awe inspiring, best seen on a clear day as the clouds can really limit visibility.  Great views from the tram up as well but Nong Ping is very commercial."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660868822,4,2019-3,New Zealand,""We had a fun day here, it was quite busy and wait times were roughly 20   30 minutes per ride. Plenty of eating places and souvenir shops available.

"660549776,4,2019-3,Canada,""Tickets were cheaper than other Disneys. Fast Pass was the bomb as we pre bought. The best rides were Mansion and the Grizzly Man Coaster. Space Mountain is not as good as Florida, California and even Paris. Ironman is okay. Pooh bear is good. This park is way smaller than the others which keeps the day simple. You only need one day here."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660533490,3,2019-3,South Africa,""Having been to Florida, Anaheim and Euro Disney, Hong Kong Disney is definately the smallest, however given 5 hours to a day of spare time we think it is worth a visit.

"660438885,5,2019-2,China,""Without a doubt, a true Disney experience.The parades, the rides, the characters and cast members all blend to make a great day with the kids.The journey is not long, and the MtR takes you literally to the front gate, so it is convenient for strollers.They will allow you to enter with baby food, as there are not many healthy options inside.With the classics like Small World, the park train, Main St. and the Castle you will not lack any of the    magical    feel.Make sure to have your tickets before as the line can be tedious in the morning, so don   t waste any time at the ticket counter"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660325857,5,2019-3,Hong Kong,""I've seen many negative posts and comments on HK Disneyland in the past. It is really not that bad. Yes, it is expensive and small but it has tons of rides for all ages.As an HK resident, I always go to Hk Disneyland and the experience is the same every time. Whether it is the parade or the rides, the park is incredible. There has been tons of revamps in the past few years with the farewells to Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters but has been replaced with a brand new section in Tomorrowland featuring Iron Man and Ant Man coming in April as well as a brand new revamp of Space Mountain. The staff are extremely helpful and the gift shops have loads of merchandise and souvenirs. The park is also extremely kid friendly. The only negative I can extract from this park is the food price. The food isn't that bad but for it's quality, it is way too expensive. Since visitors aren't allowed to bring food in, you might have to starve for a day or buy an expensive meal.If you have lots of free time in HK and want something enjoyable whether with the kids or with your mates, HK Disney is a great park although if you are a major thrill seeker, Ocean Park would be more suited for you."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660285578,2,2019-3,Canada,""Very very small, disappointing all along the line... the park is too small, without big attractions. In 3 hours you will have seen everything. There was construction with a lot of noise during our visit. It was ridiculous to visit the enchanted forest when you heard a jackhammer!! The maneges are limited. The prices are high for the quality of the park. It is better to keep your money and invest it in another activity "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660263284,5,2019-3,India,""The place is no less..It is Disneyland :)My kid had amazing fun and the place is massive.It is such a wonderful place to visit when your kid is old enough to qualify all rides.My boy is 112 Cms and pretty much qualified every single ride.I loved adventure land personally as it is involved tree houses,boat rides etc...Mystic Mansion was out of the world..soooo digital and so well done..Eating options for Veg folks are very very very limited.Asked around inside the park about...veg food and people kinda looked at us weird..lol..Vegie Burger was the best we could get at 98$...Was not great but DLand compensated for the non food part..You could have ice creams at 45 HKD and pop corn at the same price.I liked the HK Tea in packed form.it was good.Bus from Disneyland R8 to Lantau costs around 6 HKD(very inexpensive) and i stayed at TST(Tsim Sha Tsui).From Lantau toll toook A21 to go to TST Prat Avenue.Costs around 28 HKD per Adult and around 20 HKD per child below 11.If you take a taxi from Dinsey to TST,considering decent traffic,it would set you off by 205 HKD one way.Peak traffic could cost you around 250 HKD to 275 HKD.Disney is a must visit and we took 2 days to do it as queue(s) are long and minimum it took us 45 mins of queuing to get to any attractions.Infants and toddlers,cap is mandatory and be ready to buckle up and stand the long queue(s),unless you have a priority pass."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
660238861,5,2019-3,United States,I really loved Disneyland! The two must rides are the Mystic Manor and the Grizzly Gulch Runaway Mine Trains. Both are excellent. Highly recommend going on a weekday. We did not have a wait longer than 20 minutes any where on a Monday and Tuesday. You don't need the Priority Special or Priority Special   on weekdays.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660061838,4,2019-2,Indonesia,""Came here 1 day after Chinese New Year, it was very crowded, try googling for the best time to visit the Disneyland. They had a few big parades around the theme park at certain hours, the last one was at 2000 hrs. To avoid rushing back with other visitors, I tried staying back after the last parade and got on the MTR after most of the visitors had left.The theme park provide strollers for rent, be careful not to lose the deposit slip or they wouldn't cash your deposit when you return the strollers.My kids enjoyed every parade especially the last one at 2000 hrs, with all the lightworks and Disney characters out on the street."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"660034324,4,2019-3,Philippines,""An Amusement Park for all ages. Disneyland is for children and a adult that are young at heart. Its a place that you will enjoy. The best time to visit is March were the weather was good, that you will enjoy roaming around."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"659790654,5,2019-3,Indonesia,""This is my first time going to Disneyland Hong Kong. Unfortunately the Cinderella castle is being renovated and firework show being canceled. Shows such as Mickey and the Wondrous Book or Lion King are amazing. The parade in the afternoon is also good because we can see all Disney cartoon characters coming out. I love big grizzly mountain runaway because it was thrilling. I recommend you to buy popcorn which sold at stand throughout Disneyland, it tastes good."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"659781438,3,2019-3,Philippines,""In HK now crowds are the norm, and Disneyland is no exception. It was a weekday but was still very crowded, I hate to think what its like on the weekend.Some areas were unavailable due to remodeling works, which was sad, but some new areas had been opened since our last visit and these were quite good.There are lots of rides for  children  of all ages, so enjoy yourself and have a good day.Buy your ticket before you arrive, saves time and some queues, and many times they are cheaper than at the gate.Easily accessible by the MRT from all over HK. Its not the biggest Disneyland in the world, but it made our little one smile all day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"659769508,5,2019-2,Philippines,""We went here w my family by invitation. Coming to Disneyland brings the child in you scream and enjoy fun times especially if you have kids w you in the trip. As usual, even on a Mondays, the queing for the long lines of activities will leave you to make ceratin choice events, rides, etc. We did get a roller coaster ride on Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, photos taken w the Iron Man who was strutting around for poses w us, parades, store buys, etc. But what made the stay most memorable was the live presentation of Lion King musical wc made the final cut of our 'one day' experience @ Disney memorable!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"659760916,4,2018-11,Hong Kong,""Nice and cute small Disney. Attractions do slowly expand, but most are just fun rollercoasters for family. Many smaller rides to enjoy with small kids.

659463395,4,2019-3,Australia,This is a smaller park than American Disneyland. My favourite part was the lion king show. It had great costumes acrobatics makeup and props. My grandson does not want to go to Theatre but changed his mind after this show. Staff were sometimes too busy talking to other staff to assist and sometimes abrupt. Overall though we had a great time. I think American Disneyland set a huge standard that was hard to match. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The rides are okay but as usual, super crowded and busy, especially the lunch hours where the queue can be as long as 45 mins to an hour. Food is so so, especially for the Starliner restaurant that serves western food. Ticket came with a food coupon for purchase of meal up to $149HK. Bought the recommended value set to maximise it but the burger was so pathetic, small, flat and the meat was half. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"659068670,5,2019-3,United Kingdom,""My husband and I love Disney and have visited quite a few of them. Hong Kong is a great park to visit! My favourite ride was the Mystic Manor   it has nothing to do with Disney, but a great little story which is a bit funny and has amazing detail in the ride. I believe it   s for HK only so really special. The run away train is quite deceiving, it starts of slow and you start to think it   s a bit rubbish...but it then surprises you. A winner with us. We got our tickets with Klook as this was by far the cheapest. It even came with the option for a meal deal which was did as it mean we didn   t have to worry about that. The food at Disney wasn   t great but ok. They are working on the castle at the moment and think it may take a while. At the moment it   s tiny! We found it so odd seeing the castle like this, but it   s because they didn   t have the money to build a bit castle. They do not so fireworks at the moment because of this but they are doing a light show at Main Street which was good. HK Disney has a toy story land, built before the one in Orlando. It   s really good but I love toy story. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is a special train that takes you there. There is an obsession with Duffy at the park. We went on a week day and entered when the park first opened. The only lines we encountered were for the characters. Easy to do in 1 day. Lots of great food options that is not your typical Disney fare.

"658697573,2,2019-2,United Kingdom,""As my husband and I had a free day before we flew back home , decided to visit here, being that as we are over the age of 64 we got entry of just under   10 each depending on the currency rate. This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It   s the happiest place on earth, and it   s great.It is a small park, at least by Anaheim and Tokyo standards, and can be easily covered in a few hours. This leaves plenty of time for shopping and hitting the rides you like multiple times.We came on a Tuesday in early March and arrived at park open. The weather was nice out, but the lines were, thankfully, almost non existent. Even after the usual busy times of 1 2pm, most lines were less than 15 mins.We bought a priority pass, but in hindsight it wasn   t at all required. In the end we just used it to get the value, but we were really just skipping 5 minute queues, so it was a waste of money on this particular occasion. Perhaps we got lucky and other days would make it worth the money but I am unsure.The RC car and Grizzly were my favourite rides, both extremely thrilling.Disneyland HK is a must see if you   re here, but not the best Disneyland in my experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are enough rides and attractions to make the trip worthwhile, and it is very easily accessible by the MTR Trains. Main disappointment Wes that there were no characters strolling thru the park to mingle with visitors. That may be because of overcast and potentially rainy skies. In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee. In Orlando Florida, people have to buy a ticket for each of the four or five parks they want to visit, That gets really expensive. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's said that it's only available in Hong Kong, no other Mystic Manor in any other Disneyland. So we had to go there! Although it wasn't a thrilling ride, it was still fun & very amusing for us. The MM souvenirs were also very cute. We spent quite amount of money there, because no other MM souvenirs at any other Disneyland shop (not even at the shop at the Hong Kong Airport!). So if you go there & find something you like, BUY it. Don't hesitate The only downsides were the Sleeping Beauty Castle & the Winnie the Pooh ride was closed for maintenance."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"656142751,5,2018-12,Canada,""Easy to get there, only need to take the subway, inside the subway there is also disney decoration so can take pictures while heading there. Very convenience and clean. Inside the disney park, there are lots of cute sounveir shops, area is clean, people are friendly. Lots of disney characters to take pic with, not that long line up, it depends on the time and month you go. Although its not a big disney but you can still spend a whole day there.

"656000962,5,2019-2,United States,""I'm working my way to all the Disney parks around the world. I've already hit Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, this is my fourth location (Tokyo in 2020 and Shanghai 2021). Although this park is slightly larger than Anaheim it doesn't really feel like it. They have fewer attractions crammed into a small space like the original. Overall the park is clean, themed well and all the cast members we came into contact with were pleasant. I don't think you can compare Disney parks to each other, it's just not fair. I like the HK version although a lot of the attractions were mirror images (or very close) to rides in other Disney parks. Although they are branching out with the Iron Man Experience (think Star Tours with Iron Man) and the new Ant Man and Wasp attraction (which was not yet open when we went in February 2019.) Mystic Manor is HK's answer to the Haunted Mansion. It has a compelling story with a character (Albert the monkey) that draws you in and it has great effects. HK DL is almost worth it just for this one attraction, we rode it twice. Although not as big as FL and not as detailed as Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely worth a visit."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"655940742,2,2019-2,Australia,""One of the group had been to Disneyland in Japan and wanted to go to this one.I had been told was the staff are very friendly, welcoming and peppy plus the mascots milling about and very fun. Don   t know if upwelling went on a bad day or something but it was not a great experience. With the exception of two staff none of them smiled or made you feel welcome. As to for the mascots, finally saw them at the end of our day and only in the    town    part.Costumes were ruined by staff wearing black running shoes. OK they are on their feet and need to be comfortable but it was seriously jarring. Staff get a 2 10.Things like the recycling bin being loaded and taken away to be emptied but not one put in to replace. Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money. I was told Disneyland HK was loosing money and I am not surprised.We went on a number of rides and they all had positives. Loved the Ironman ride, Starwars and the roller coaster in the Gulch."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"655891314,5,2019-1,New Zealand,""HK Disney is the smallest of the Disney Parks and definitely something you can cover in a day. We contemplates doing a VIP tour as we had done in WDW, but left it too late to book and in the end glad that I didn't waste my money here as it just wasn't needed unless you were to go on one of the Chinese holidays.We stayed in HK central and took the train out which was easy to do with them running every few minutes, it really didn't matter if you missed one. Even the return at night despite all the people it was frequent enough that there was never a significant wait. The People are somewhat pushy though it's some form of FOMO(fear or missing out). The train doors open people push in and out. If you finish one ride it seems you need to run to the next one so you can get ahead of 2 people. Rope drop which would normally allow a flow of people into the park was more like the starting gun of the New York Marathon.That said, we loved the park. Favorite ride is Phantom Manor, similar type of ride to Ratatouille in France but with some magical effects. The light show at night is also worth staying to check out.As a tall person 6' 4  I did find myself having to contort myself into seats to fit my legs in. Same thing with Tokyo, but you can fit. I found crossing my legs and moving my feet as far back in the seat as I could before sitting down made a difference.The Lion King show was amazing so I would put that down as a must!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The park was very small and I feel the price is extortionate when comparing it to Disneyland Paris   which is much larger and significantly cheaper. I found that it didn   t have the magic of Disney and it just felt like any old theme park. The staff were not particularly friendly and they didn   t engage with guests at all   in fact, I was ignored by a group of 3 staff members!

We thought that the park will be packed since is the holiday season but luckily the park is moderately packed.My thought about this place is a great place to spend your day in your HK trip. The park is very nice and it was smaller than your typical Disney park. Compared to other Disney park I've ever visited, this theme park has shortest waiting time especially for thrill seeker attraction and of course no need to check all the fast pass.You can download the apps beforehand to check the schedule for the parade, map, and waiting time for each attraction. Unfortunately in our visit, the Sleeping Beauty castle is still under construction but we managed to enjoy Disney Christmas Celebration.In our visit, We managed to enjoy 6 rides, 1 parade, 2 shows in our 4 hours of visit. If You're a thrill seeker, don't forget to enjoy the two attractions exclusive in HK Disneyland, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor.

Crowds were OK for mid week and winter. Cost HK619 for the day each adult. We ate in the explorers club restaurant and had an Asian curry which was OK although a bit bland to cater for all tastes.

"654876699,4,2019-2,United States,""I personally haven't gone to a Disneyland outside of California so I didnt know what to expect. The cultural ties to the Chinese culture that they implemented at the park was simply amazing. This is probably the only park where Mickey can speak Cantonese. The park is very clean, it was smaller than your typical Disney park. There are various shows you can watch throughout the park. The rides are similar to what you would find in California. I believe the Iron Man attraction might be unique to HK. The park was busy but not to the point where we had to wait hours for a ride. It averaged 30 minutes or so per ride. If you're looking to experience something different from Disney, this would be the place to go. We only went for the day and was able to go on everything we wanted to go on. Just keep in mind that this park is smaller. I would not recommend coming here during Chinese New Year or Golden Week."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"654750950,5,2019-2,United States,""I   ve visited every Disney park except Shanghai and this is perhaps my favorite for a toddler. It   s a close replica of the Anaheim Disneyland but smaller without some of the big kid rides. PROs:1) For a Disney park, it   s not very crowded. I love Tokyo Disney Sea but the crowds really kill the experience there. People in Hong Kong apparently do not wake up early even when the park opens at 930am. There   s really are no lines for the first couple hours. Even during the busiest hours, the lines are moderate. 2) I love the variety of foods from all different regions. I actually looked forward to meals. 3) When we were there, they were 6 different times for the Jedi training and it was never full. 4) Admission tickets are so much cheaper than any other Disney park in the world. You can use apps like Klook to buy discount tickets and discount meals. If your children are under 7, this really is the perfect Disney experience. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

If you are family with kids, it's a must visit place, you can meet almost all Disney characters, and don't forget to capture your moments, there are so many beautiful photo spot to be captured. Suggestion: you'd better come in the morning, since the weather is not too hot and there will be more crowded in the afternoon. And if you are not in rush, be sure to see the parade or the fireworks show in the night (about 30 minutes before the closing time), that's really worth the wait, and I can say that's one of the best show I have ever seen."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We went in February on a damp day. Not overly busy, with queue times between 0 and 10 minutes without any kind of priority boarding ticket. Having been to Disney Land Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida I was still hugely impressed and couldn   t stop smiling for the whole visit. A real mixture of East and West themes going on, similar in so many ways but different enough to make it still feel new. There was some building work going on around the castle and as a result the train wasn   t working though that didn   t detract from the day. Log in to the Disney Land Wi Fi and we got a HK$10 voucher. Thoroughly enjoyed Toy Story Land. The classic area of Tomorrow Land rebranded as Star Wars & Marvel.

You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park.

Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I don't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando! Disneyland is out on Lantau Island. Although we had fun, I would probably spend my time doing other things next time. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

650783012,4,2018-9,Turkey,We chose a Chinese National holiday to visit Disneyland so it was busy but as we were travelling with small kids we were too worried about going on a lot of rides. We had bought the meal deal tickets but found they weren   t good value as they limited our choices for lunch. The Moana show was great and the park was easily accessible for our 2 year old. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"650641639,4,2019-1,United States,""I've gone to both Disney parks in California and Orlando and while HK Disneyland is very small in comparison, I loved how this park won't have you exhausted by the end of the day and still allow for other activities after you've finished your time. This was how I scheduled my time with my friend. 11 am met a friend at Nam Cheong MTR and rode over to the Disneyland Line. A smart thing to do would be to buy your tickets on your phone as you are riding the MTR. (We didn't and wasted some time at the ticket gate)Once we were in we took our rounds of pictures. The first impression was,  Wow, that's the castle? How awful.  Though when I was there they blocked off the castle so they will be making a more robust castle soon from what I'm understanding.In other parks like Japan and the USA, it's all about looking for the snacks all around the park. (Here's looking at you Dole Whip) I need to get this out of the way, the food is awful at HK Disney. This fact really surprised me given that there's so much good food in HK but it really was pretty horrid. Friend and I had some bad lunch and then went along to other rides. Most rides were about a 20 minute wait which I thought was very acceptable. I think the longest wait we had was for Hyperspace Mountain and that was for 40 minutes.Checked out the parade and was actually hoping for Asian women dressed up as Cinderella or Snow White. Nope. God forbid Snow White is an Asian. But I suppose I get it. lolAfter some snack fails and a Philharmagic 3D show we exited the park at around 6 pm. Took the MTR straight to Tsim Sha Tsui for a nice dinner at 7 pm. At 9 pm, friends and I were parked at a whisky bar and then by 11:30 pm I was home in bed.It was one of the most amazing days because this type of Disney excursion never happens in either California or Florida simply give the scale of the parks and also how awful public transportation is in either cities.I wouldn't recommend coming to HK for Disneyland, that would be a let down. However, if you're sightseeing in HK and have time for Disney, it's a no brainer to go."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"650483884,5,2019-1,United Arab Emirates,""Our 3 year old daughter loves all of the Disney princesses so we had to take her to Disneyland.

Even though the park isn   t as big as the two in America it   s not missing anything for our 3 year old but it would be lacking in rides and activities for older kids to teens.

When we went back to one of the stores to check if we dropped it there while paying for merchandise the store lady was very rude. She rudely asked bow do we know it's your even if we find it. I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I couldn't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they can't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code wouldn't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays. It was crowded but well organised. Some of the places were closed since they are expanding.

If you in HK, do not go to this rip off expensive overpriced park, which is not even worth HK$10 let alone paying over HK$400. There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something.

"647569763,4,2018-2,United Arab Emirates,""I visited this superb amusement and theme park two times already. On this last visit , I took my 86 yr old father with me. He enjoyed like a child. The whole area is divided into 7 zones and each of the zones is uniquely planned and designed with the speciality of that zone in mind. Each zone has a ride, a show , an eatery for that area. I loved the Grizzly bears mining area with that stupendous ride!! The zone is planned with hot water geizers and rocky mountainous type. Excellent. Also the space ride area was too good. Starwars themed people were going around. The ride was great. I also liked the Little children's boat rides. The shows were a little less exciting for us. Because it's really for the small kids. There is a nice rail line around the park for easy travel. We bought the online tickets from the website. That made the enty super easy. Also I had the priority pass for us  that's free, my father had the senior ticket very cheap. The passes really helped us to see everything fast. U need to walk around a lot. But lots of resting places and refreshments are available to take it slow. Protect your head with hats.One day finishes like a sweet dream. Interested people can take the two day ticket if so inclined. There is also a hotel inside which can be included in the package. At designated times there are themed festivities, procession and fireworks which attracts lot of crowds. The journey from the city takes around 1 hr.

"647328225,1,2019-1,Australia,""Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience.

Space Mountain is a combination of Space Mountain and Star Wars. Quite hysterical Hearing R2 D2in your ear while riding in the dark. The haunted house is a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark style seating and has some of the facts of the haunted house. The jungle cruise is way better then California Disney. The whole Adventure Land is very green and Lush. The Toy Story Land is incredible. Full of lots of great rides. The Thunder Mountain is amazing and much better than California.

They seemed to be easier to access than California. They also interacted better. Overall: 1 day is enough for regular travellers. Disney freaks will need 2 days to see everything. We did 2 days and went on major attractions 3 4 times and just took our time. It was much less stressful than California! The castle is getting renovated and will be completed I believe next year.

We went to China to complete his around the world Disneyland parks by going to Hong Kong and Shanghai. This park like all Disney operation was clean, well laid out, great service and well worth the money. Don't expert a mirror of LA. Plenty of people speak English at least enough to point you in the right direction. Rides were great, food selection is extensive and night activities are well done. It is a long subway ride from Hong Kong then a pretty long walk to front gate. IMPORTANT TIP do not take in any kinds of bags or purses. Put whatever you need in your pockets.

"646389071,5,2018-12,United States,""Hong Kong Disneyland has the magic of the Magic Kingdom but is much smaller in size. It is therefore less crowded and easier to navigate. The downside is the quality and price of the food offered in the restaurants and hotels. There is really no other option unless one takes the subway off site It is also hard to find a willingness in the employees to accommodate special diets such as gluten free. Our granddaughter has celiacs and we asked for ice cream in a dish rather than a cone. You would think we had asked for something unbelievably difficult for them to do. They would only give us the ice cream in a cardboard paper french fry container and not in a plastic cup that they used to serve sundaes in. We found this same reluctance to make exceptions when ordering in all of the restaurants there. It was surprising to find this at a place with the Disney brand, especially considering their prices for food. The actual park tickets and hotel tickets were reasonable."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"645245762,5,2019-1,United Kingdom,""My husband and I had a long layover at the airport, so we left our bags at the Left Luggage counter in Terminal 2 and caught a blue taxi to Disneyland. I   ve visited both Disney parks in the States many times, so I was excited to see the similarities and differences at the Hong Kong park.We arrived around 2:30 pm, and there was absolutely no queue. The ticket counter employee kindly informed us that there was no need to purchase fast pass tickets given the small number of guests at the park that day. And she was right! The longest queue was for 25 minutes for Winnie the Pooh. Otherwise, we walked right on to rides or waited 5   10 minutes. I have never seen a Disney park less crowded (we visited on January 9th).Like all Disneys, the park is charming and well done. There is a LOT of construction right now, including the castle and construction in Tomorrowland. There is a strong focus on photographs   so many character meet and greets and photo opportunities everywhere. Perhaps this is due to the new Instagram focused world we live in. It was fascinating to see so many dressed up guests ready for their pictures   high heels, designer dresses, lipstick, etc. This is not your normal turkey leg eating guest at the Florida park. :)The park appears to be quite small compared to CA Disneyland. We spent about 3.5 hours at the park and we were ready to go (we only rode the majority of the rides once). The roller coasters were a bit more exciting than those in the States   Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (which looks like Thunder Mountain Railroad) is much more exciting. It was also interesting to see the similarities and differences between Mystic Manor and the Haunted Mansion. There were also a few new rides and experiences that I hadn   t seen in the States.I   m glad we didn   t take a full day out of our initial visit to Hong Kong to visit Disney, but it was the perfect place to spend a long layover.

"645088792,5,2019-1,Australia,""Smaller and with much less    challenging    rides than Ocean Park, HK Disneyland nevertheless really delivers.We went to HKDL only a couple of days after OP and thought it might be theme park overkill, but easily managed to keep going from before opening (we arrived 15    prior to 10.30am start) until closing after the final street parade. The family, including 17, 20 and 22 year olds, each had an awesome time. The lines were short (a Thursday in January), the weather perfectly in the Goldilocks zone, the rides fun albeit not too much of a challenge, and the vibe was ideal (how can you not get into it when fully 10 20% of the adult guests are wearing Mickey  Minnie ears or other HKDL headgear?!). I can even recommend forking out slightly extra in buying the combo food package (something I normally eschew), and definitely suggest it   s well worth purchasing online prior to going. If you can only go to one park I   d suggest HKDL on balance (cleaner, easier, fewer queues and less walking), unless you   re after more of a    local    flavour or want more thrill seeking rides. Ideally do both and make your own comparisons. Either way, enjoy the ride!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It   s easy to get to (take the train from HK central to Sunny Bay, on the Tung Chung line, then change at Sunny Bay, then the purpose built Disneyland line (Mickey theming literally everywhere!) to the resort. It   s around 600$HK which is around   60 or US$75 for a one day pass, and one day is really all you need. (They do sting you a little on the locker charges though). It has all the Disney touches you   d expect at a Disney park, but it   s very small and compact. I was lucky that the day I visited crowds were low. I never queued more than 10min for anything. Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride were great, Tomorrowland is probably the best for adult guests. The mine train in Grizzly Gulch is great too. Mystic Manor will seem strange if you   re used to the Haunted Mansion, but it has its own charm. Almost everything is kid friendly and Fantasyland seems to take up a larger proportion of the park than in Florida or California.

The Mickey light show in main street was excellent and very well done but sadly the night show that we waited for was cancelled 2 mins before it was due to start because of about 3mins of a VERY light rain shower. We have visited Florida Disney many times and it is obviously far superior but the main comment I have to say is that every single staff member at Hong Kong looked miserable and that they didn't really want to be there, by comparison Florida staff are bursting with smiles and fun. Not many large rides here and only two fast pass rides. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was just average food.

We had been to Disneyland California and roughly knew the rides we wanted to get on, so headed straight for them. We rode quite a few of the rides with little to no waiting time and made our way around the park easily picking rides depending on wait time.

Some rides opened early while others opened a little later. The castle was under construction, so that isn't a good picture right now. We did the Ironman ride which was very fun and there was no line at all. It seems that since Shanghai Disney opened it isn't as crowded at Hong Kong Disney. We did all the big rides that we wanted to do and funny enough the longest line was for Jungle Cruise. Haha! Our new favorite ride is Mystic Manor, a new and terrific version of Haunted Mansion. It is really well done! Be sure you see it! We loved the park! We made a reservation at Crystal Lotus but didn't have a cute dim sum reservation so we were not able to get that. I wrote a separate review on that restaurant. We had done the whole park and shopped by 1 pm. As we headed out to go to the Disneyland Hotel around 1pm, the crowds coming in were insane!

Our favorite rides were the Grizzly Gulch, Hyperspace Mountain, and Iron Man Experience. My number one tip is to get there right at 10:00. No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good.

The Mystic Manor ride was good but the queue was abysmal, and not very clearly signposted. The riverboat ride was fantastic, largely because of the guide who deserves either an Oscar or a pay rise for her brilliant commentary. The Runaway Mine Carts ride was extremely good fun, and very well done in terms of safety. Most queues moved surprisingly quickly, and it was all relatively painless, even for a Disney cynic like me.

The expectation was actually too much with all the video and pictures on line.There were very few characters to mingle with. A couple of them just came out a few minutes for picture shoots and headed back in. The on line videos showed Disney characters just walking around the park, interacting with people, making the ambiance of the park more Disney like. This was actually the expectation. I was expecting Cylons, Jedis, Mickey, Minne. Goofy, etc to been seen in the park. But unfortunately, we actually had to look for them.The entertainment in itself was not bad. The place was clean and the staff friendly. But the magical experience did not reach its peak.Don't go there with too much of expectation, or else you might be disappointed like I was. Worth a visit but not for repeats."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"643272932,4,2019-1,Australia,""Having previously been to Walt Disney World, I decided to take my kids to Hong Kong Disneyland for their first Disney park experience. This decision was mainly based on it being a smaller park so a little bit easier on their little legs. They absolutely adored it! My six year old went on every ride (apart from RC Racer due to height) and apart from Mystic Manor (which he found a little scary), he loved them all. The look of delight in my three year old   s face was also sweet. It was a fantastic warmer for the bigger parks in the U.S.A. One day park? Definitely not. We did every single ride (apart from RC Racer and Tarzan   s House) and every single show (apart from Moana) and parades, net characters, did none of the gardens and we just fit it into two days. And we were there from open to close with a stack of fast passes in hand. Maybe we were slowed down due to having little kids with us but I don   t know how people do the park in one day and do it justice. Where the park lost a star was the food and merchandise. The food was gross. That   s all I can say about that. The merchandise? Well unfortunately there were heaps of shops on Main Street but they all stocked exactly the same merchandise. Apart from Pandora which I don   t personally wear, there was nothing for adults. The variety just wasn   t there and the selection that was there was poor. Would I go back? Probably not now that it has been done but we are looking forward to the next Disney park. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

All the staff and all the visitors (local and foreign) were very polite and we had a great time. If you are not a fan of roller coasters Disney Hong Kong is the place to go. It offers more family moments and spreads its magic through beautiful shows like Moana, The lion king, the story book. The park is not that big and can be done in 2 days. Watch out for the timing for Disney parades. Be prepared to queue up to 60 minutes for the popular rides and shows. We will surely go back to Disney Hong Kong. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Remember, if you are 65 and over, there is a huge discount! Normal entry fee is HKD615 and over 65 is HKD100. You can't purchase senior tickets online and have to do it when you are there.

They should have additional time or Atleast post the timeline in a map direction for visitor   s reference! 4. Sellers here are rude! They will not give you unless you pay first, (as if you   re not going to pay if you order duh ) 5. Good for kids who don   t like extreme rides. 6. Picture in maze imposed limited time also.

642534419,2,2018-12,Singapore,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back!

639082709,4,2018-12,Singapore,It's my family's first visit to HK Disneyland. The year end season provides both the climate and the atmosphere for christmas themed shows and celebrations taking place in the park though the day. It's a great place for children with various rides shows eateries which are family and child friendly. My only tip is to try and go on a weekday as the crowds in the weekend are understood to be really massive. I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones. My thoughts are that a 1 day visit is sufficient unless you intend to go for all the rides shows and you have children with you.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Apart from the rather small Sleeping Beauty Castle being under renovation, what stood out were how small the park was and expensive food. As it was not yet peak visitation and helped by slightly rainy weather (which also ruined some outdoor shows and parades), we managed to cover all the rides and shows we wanted in a day. Of all the attractions, we liked The Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book, Iron Man Experience and Mickey   s Philharmagic."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children.

"638478152,5,2018-10,India,""Disneyland is made basically for children but it   s really amazing for adults too. we were there in first few of October and it was not so busy time there, still 2 days are not sufficient to enjoy the whole Disneyland. We enjoyed there every second of the time we spent there. Not only your children, you will not like to come back from Disneyland. Everything is made there is to mesmerise you. Starting from the toy train to meeting the ICONIC Mickey mouse. You can   t forget a single second of your time spent here.Disneyland is divided in 7 sections. In which only two sections have rides, in which fantasyland is for young children and tomorrowland is for adults and teens.Other than rides, you will see, ironman museum with an awesome 7D show. Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland.

"638438046,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,""As a resident of Hong Kong, and very close to Disneyland, we   ve been visiting here often ever since it opened. We used to have yearly passes for the whole family. It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

That said we had a great time, we brought a 2 day pass as there was not much difference in price of 1 day before we went, we also purchased the food package of 2 meals and a snack. The food you get with this deal is very filling and we struggled to get through all the food we could have. The snack was either popcorn or an ice cream and the meals were full size dinners with soft drink. Everything that we ate was very tasty.Possibly the 1 meal and a snack option would have suited us better.It was very quiet there when we went and hardly had to queue for the rides and didn   t need to use fast passes at all.decorations for Christmas were really good but I was disappointed that there was not much In the way of Disney Christmas ornaments to purchase.All in all we had a great time, I still can   t get over how small the castle is, I thought the one in Paris was small but it   s huge in comparison to the one here."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

A few things went bad though  lots of waiting for every ride  15 25  minutes. Kids got tired and we gave up on some rides. The food is overpriced and tasted bad  The Main Dining Hall (up to 20 USD for a tasteless meal), food stalls with outdated corn for 4 USD 4, sausages 5 USD. Actually all soft drinks in the Park cost HKD 32 ( 4  USD) and you are not allowed to bring your own food! Another point  it's close to Christmas time, a lot of Christmas music was being played non stop including Church hymns like Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, O Come All Ye Faithful, etc. Sounds too religious, not suitable for kids, a bight of brainwashing so to say. And no wi fi at the park at all.

The VIP experience is worth it, especially if the park is busy. Be sure to get the armbands for the parade   you get the best seats possible with no jockeying.5.

The Moana show was ok but Moana didn   t sing so we left. Good food options and lots of lands to explore. Definitely smaller than Disney so if you start early you could see most of the park in a day.

636961092,5,2018-12,India,Our visit to Disneyland was planned solely for son who   s 4 year old. That we would also have so much fun was not known The whole environment is one of gala and celebrations. The different worlds created within Disneyland make for one new experience after the other. It is humanly impossible to do all the rides and there is a fair bit of walking in between the different    lands    and quite a wait for the very popular rides. You can you the fast access to plan though. The only downer was the food options. If you are fussy you should plan your movement through Disneyland to be around the restaurant that serves food that you like. The dining options are a bit pricey for the fare offered but that   s come to be expected of all entertainment parks et al. The rides themselves are brilliant. My wife is particular got nostalgic when she did the small world ride again after 15 odd years. The Iron man ride is a do not miss ride. Couple of pieces of advise:A. Plan your route. For eg. come to the Iron man ride in the evening. Nearly no waiting around that time. Plan where you want to have lunch and decide the route for covering the various lands.B. Plan which rides and attractions you want to cover or are must do. C. Get hold of the maps once you enter and the show timings. There are different shows and the timings vary. Also the popular ones go full sometimes 30 mins in advance. D. And finally see the timing of the parades. There a few in the evening. The grand finale at the park closing time is not to be missed. It gets crowded there so try and get there to get a good path side place. Honestly it   s near impossible to cover the park in a single day. Even most good ones would take a day to cover even at a rapid pace. Two days would give you the ability to cover the park in a relaxed manner. Goes without saying a must do. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The park opens later than other Disney parks which worked out for us because we could actually sleep in on vacation. The park is small but absolutely lovely. I found that our only negative was some pushy guests at parade time. There were virtually no lines for most rides. Our hotel gave us fastpasses but we didn   t need a single one. Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters.

"636822111,4,2018-11,United Kingdom,""We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasn't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you couldn't find the end of the line. If you want to get gifts and don't want to queue there is a hong kong disney store at the airport with the same prices and a fair bit of stock."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was quite rude and yelled at children repeatedly, then yelled at parents. A child and parent who got out of line were allowed to rejoin the line ahead of me and my son. This was also frustrating as we had been waiting for quite some time to see Pluto. I didn't find it overly expensive, it's Disney!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"636521622,5,2018-11,South Africa,""I read alot of reviews on this and was a bit concerned that it wasnt worth going but this was an absolutely amazing experience. I will note that i am a huge disney fan and that this was my first disney part visit.We arrived early and seemed to be at the start of tourist season. It was busy but not too bad. We didnt stand in a line for longer than 20 minutes. When the park opens you are first only allowed in the shopping area, obviously so you can buy stuff and they can make money but there is sooooo much to choose from.We went on most of the rides and went on them twice   once at day and once at night.We bought the tickets and food vouchers on Klook and this was a great savings and also really worth it.The rides were really fun and the overall ride experience was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the mine cart in the grizzly grouch area, as well as the star wars ride and the toy story horse shoe.The parades   we watched both the day and night parades   were absolutely spectacular and definitely worth going to   just a tip though is to find a spot about 30 minutes before the parade is due to start as there are alot of people.Also try and find a spot towards the end of main street USA where the road splits to the different parks as the last few floats and characters dont go all the way to the bottom of the road.We also managed to watch two of the shows. The Lion King which was amazing and then Moana which was great but the Lion King was definitely a way better experience.The only let down was that the characters are not walking around so they were only available for short time slots and for a limited amount of people so you had to try and plan your day around this."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"636478172,5,2018-11,United Kingdom,""Disneyland is a must when you visit Hong Kong, it is located near the airport which is out of the way depending on where you are staying.We were staying the New Territories (Sha Tin), fortunately there is a bus that goes to Lantau Island Plaza where we then change to Disneyland bus (R8) which take us straight to Disneyland, all in all taking around 40 mins to get there.There are many ways to get the Disneyland the MTR, the blue coloured taxis or bus, the bus is definitely the cheaper option costing under $50 HKD per person.Entry to the park is quite expensive costing $699 per adult and $515 per child (as of October 2018) in total costing   210 GBP.Within the park there are many various rides that suits all ages, from the infamous Hyperspace Mountain to the jungle cruise.The eatery within the park are reasonable priced. We visited the park during a weekday and even though there was a lot of people in the park, the queues for rides were very good, averaging around a 10 minute wait.The parade is not to be missed and was very well put together. During our visit in October 2018 there was construction work being carried out on the Princess Castle, so there was no firework display in the evening. Overall, we have a fantastic day and out young children loved their time in Disneyland Hong Kong and it was definitely worth the visit.

The kids are young so they rode on rides that suited their age group. Not a huge variety of food but there are a few restaurant cafes around. My only safety concern was lack of security guards or police presence. I caught a man taking pictures of my child along with other kids while watching the Moana live show. He was on his own not accompanied by a child or family. He was taking photos of young teenagers too. I confronted him to delete but he didn   t speak English. Managed to delete but this didn   t stop him doing it again. We spotted him a few times. While waiting for our turn on rides 2 other I saw two native people taking photos of my own children I asked them to stop and intervened but again people don   t speak English. They   d stare like it was completely normal and I   m over reacting. It made me very upset, angry and furious and this behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when it comes to children.

Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show.

Download the App and it tells you the current wait times all over the park.It is much smaller than Disneylands but that was good for us with 2 kids under 7, it was easy to walk around the whole park a few times, and most of the rides were good for the younger kids. It might be lacking if you're after big thrills. The food was generally ok and not at astonishing prices.As it got dark we went back and had a second ride on all the things we wanted and some we had missed earlier in the day. All 3 parades we good and as it wasn't too busy everyone was able to see fine. Highlights: The Lion King show (don't miss this and it's a good airconditioned break), Mystic Manor and the Jungle River cruise (make sure you go after dark, it's much better). As people have mentioned HK Disneyland doesn't really have the characters just walking around the Park like you find in other Disneylands, so if getting pics with them is your thing you will have to line up at specific locations and times. The train out there was good, and wasn't even packed after closing time (we walked slowly back to the station).

The lines were pretty short (we were there on a Monday), the longest we waited was 20 minutes but some rides we just walked on. The shows and parades were pretty good. Except the snow show at 6:15pm. Not worth waiting around for. The park was clean, the toilets were clean, plenty of food stores (overpriced but that goes with the territory)Best rides were Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch and the Iron Man one in Tomorrow Land. My daughter said the only negative was that there were no thrill rides like a major roller coaster. Getting there via the MTR was super easy.

For popular characters expect at least 30 min to 1 hour waits to take pictures with them (eg. jack and sally for halloween). disney staff give out lots of stickers and candy during halloween. the villains night parade at the end is not as exciting as the one during the day or their regular one as the floats with the villains are plain comparatively. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Be ready to walk a lot, and wait a lot in queues if you want to take pictures with Mickey and Minnie.Most of the rides have fast track option with no additional cost. Every land has themed restaurants. Since it was halloween, everyone was dressed up in costumes, we were handed candies as a part of trick or treat, we visited the haunted house and finally watch the really cool   Villains night out parade.A definite visit to the place..where you feel anything and everything is possible. It is truly magical."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
632073306,5,2018-10,Australia,We were told that as we had been to the original parks in the USA we would be disappointed with HK Disneyland   but we were certainly not! We didn't go there expecting to see what we saw in the USA as each park has its own local charm. We enjoyed our day and loved the parades! Only issue is that there should be more taxis readily available when leaving the park as we had to wait for a while.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"631882178,5,2018-10,Australia,""Walking up to the entrance of Disneyland, it   s hard not to feel your inner kid coming out and feel super excited! It   s magical right from the beginning with beautiful statues of Mickey Mouse and his friends in a big water fountain. We arrived in the morning as soon as the park was opening and went through the ticket queue fairly fast. But the crowd was growing much quicker than expected, and later on we found out we chose a public holiday weekend so the crowds were much bigger than usual! We would advise to research this before you plan your trip because it definitely tested our patience and dampened our spirits at times. Because of this, the queues for every single ride were anywhere from 30 minutes several hours long, and it was a very hot day. We anticipated having to line up at Disneyland but the public holiday really made things 10 times slower. But when your at Disneyland, not even that can get you down, it   s just so magical and happy! One ride in each    land    had the option for you to scan your ticket and it would give you another ticket with a time frame on it, so you   re able to go and do other things then come back to skip the line within that time frame. We were then able to go on all the main rides and explore each land. There were so many amazingly fun rides to experience, as well as photo meet and greets with favourite Disney characters such as Eeyore, r2d2, iron man and more. Tarzan   s treehouse is just brilliant, toy story land is every big kids dream and we were lucky enough to see Disneyland at Halloween time, which was spectacular! We spent all day there and upon reflection, would   ve planned to spend 2 full days, regardless of the public holiday. Disneyland truly is what you imagine it to be and more! It allows you to be a child and just have fun. Would definitely go back : ) "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It   s my second time to visit HK DL and this second visit was surely better than the before. I tried more attractions. The kids most definitely enjoyed it the most. They met Mickey Mouse, Goofy, watched the Flights of Fantasy parade, Mickey Projection Show and the Villain Parade, Journey to Halloween were halloween features. The snacks were great too! Popscicles, waffles, eggette, etc. The staff were giving away lota of free stickers to the kids. And there was a lot of trick or treatin for mickey mouse marshmallows and gummy candies!!! Everything was great as expected. Disneyland HK never disappoints! As an adult, i appreciate places like these by their toilets! Hehehe. No smell, spotless clean, aaaaaand wait for it, free unlimited toilet seat covers!!!!! Sorry for that brief shallow happy episode because where i come from, no toilet seat covers are free!

Because you have so many things to cover so plan your route accordingly. As we had 2 day pass, we went around in liesure. Lion king show was mind blowing. So was Mickey and the adventure book. we had a great time. The night parade was amazing. Plan to sit atleast 30 mins ahead of the schedule so that you get the best place to watch any show.

Had to skip several rides due to their long waiting time. However, whatever rides we took, most of these were not that thrilling. There were 2 parades on that day, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Both were fun to watch, especially the evening parade with illumination was very attractive. There were no closing fireworks, told that it had been discontinued. There are restaurants inside the park, however foods were expensive and average in taste.

"631564893,4,2018-10,Malaysia,""Never having been to Disneyland before, I found it very entertaining. The space was huge and they had a very convenient luggage holding area for us to leave our luggage at HKD 110 per piece. A lot of walking involved, so was very glad we wore comfortable shoes and clothes. We bought discounted tickets via Klook and could get in with no problem. Once inside, we went to look at the rides and a lot of them were not thrill rides, but fun nonetheless. I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into creating the rides and their upkeep. Everything is perfectly maintained and no chipping paint to be seen anywhere!Delicious food is nowhere to be found in Disneyland, though. So it's just eating to survive, and your tastebuds are not taken into consideration. We managed to take all the rides we wanted to, and still take in some shows before the park closed. In the evening, the lines were much longer, because HK residents came for the evening with their annual passes. It can rain anytime in HK, so pack a raincoat if you have it. Even if it doesn't rain, it will come in handy on the mine train ride. The parade at the end of the day was really cool! Since it was halloween season, all the Disney villains came out to play."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

How I wish I could watch the fireworks in front of the castle!Note: the haunted house is small and boring, not worth waiting in a long long queue. The grey bear mine, the star wars track, iron man are my favorite. The star wars track has speed pass, which is worth fetching asap.Wifi is extremely slow. Don't rely on it!

They had a wonderful day and during the afternoon Halloween Parade they were invited to take part, however they decided to decline as they are a bit shy. The parade was very well performed. Disneyland Hong Kong can at a push be done in a day. It is one of the smaller Disney global sites, however, what it lacks in size is made up for in atmosphere. It   s a great park and well worth a visit during your stay in Hong Kong. The MTR (mass transit railway) is the easiest way to get to the site.

"630734380,5,2018-3,United States,""English language travel books and blogs like to compare Hong Kong Disneyland to Ocean Park Hong Kong. Opened in 1977, Ocean Park often gets the nod over its 13 year old rival with the more scenic location, being three times larger, having a wider range of attractions and thrill rides, and for entertaining guests with shows starring not costumed characters, but live land and marine animals. Two categories in which Ocean Park is all wet, however, are food     ho hum carnival type fare versus Disneyland   s higher quality, wider ranging dining experiences     and, the deciding factor for me, what is known as    Disney Magic.    There   s something different about being at a Disney park     the hospitality, memory making, cleanliness, positive attitude, and characters and stories beloved for generations. It   s like coming home whether you went as a child or not. HKD is the smallest of all Disney parks, but that doesn   t make a visit any less magical and unique. Its version of the Haunted Mansion is Mystic Manor, which whisks guests through the Victorian home of world traveler Lord Henry Mystic. The mansion comes alive after Henry   s mischievous pet monkey Albert opens a music box that unleashes mayhem and enchantment. Another HKD exclusive is the exciting year old Iron Man Experience";" imagine Stark Enterprises assuming sponsorship of Star Tours. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, HKD   s version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, has a section where riders go backwards. Just for fun, enter the    Cantonese    or    Mandarin    line at the Jungle Cruise to hear those tired, corny jokes in a different language. OK, so there   s no Matterhorn or Pirates of the Caribbean, but when was the last time you ate smoked duck legs and curry fish balls in Anaheim or Orlando?"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits. You CAN bring in water (I took in three bottles and showed them when entering and was let straight through) and a small amount of food, just don't bring a picnic.

"629547840,2,2017-11,Hong Kong,""Yikes, the worst thing about HK Disneyland is the never ending same same music, over and over again, the same tunes. Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long.

I had reservations about Hong Kong Disney as I have been to the other Disney parks and this one is obviously much smaller than what I am used to in the context of the magic of Disney!However, whilst small, it   s perfectly formed and there is still huge variety of things to do across the park. I would say it   s particularly geared for smaller children as the size suits their ability to get around the park and do everything. Highlights were the Flights of Fantasy parade (magical), toy story land (in particular the parachute ride) and It   s a Small World (my all time favourite!).

"629073732,5,2018-10,United States,""Reading online I felt there was a huge feeling of inferiority to this Disneyland compared to its American counterparts but I can honestly say I had a great time! It may look small on a map but I would say it felt about the same size as Disneyland California. There is so much to see and do our only downtime was sitting down to eat twice the whole day. I would say if you are a hardcore Disney fan it can be a two day park but you can definitely do it justice in one.My favourite rides (in order) were Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Car, Hyperspace Mountain and The Iron Man Experiece**. We headed straight to The Iron Man Experience and Mystic Manor when we first got to the park and faced minimal wait time   When we returned later on in the day queues had built up but we stayed onsite at the Hollywood Hotel which provided us with Fast Passes which came in very handy in these instances.** Shout out to It   s A Small World and the Dumbo rides that hold a special place in my heart too**The shows at Hong Kong Disney were amazing too   Check out Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book and Mickeys PhilharMagic. I can   t remember enjoying shows at other Disney Parks as much. The We Love Mickey show was cool too and didn   t involve having to fight with crowds for a space down Main Street   the show is literally projected into the surrounding buildings so you can stand wherever you like. At the end of the day there was a Villains Night Out show keeping with the Halloween theme and involving popular villains from your favourite Disney movies. It was a lot of fun but mostly in Chinese so apart from a whole lot of cackling I wasn   t really too sure what was going on! (Shout out to Cruella who was giving it 100!!!)As well as the shows there were parades to see too. Mickeys Flight of Fancy was the best. Again, keeping with Halloween, there was a Halloween Street Party down Main Street which was fun but could have been avoided. The Hong Kong Disneyland app came in very useful when planning my day at Disney, providing show parade times and where they were located. As you can probably tell I am a Disney fan. I honestly had a great time and feel like people are a tad harsh in relation to this park (I was constant told not to expect too much). My only disappointments are:1) the size of Sleeping Beauty castle and the fact there was a lot of construction going on around it (   pardon our dust we are creating magic   ). As my partner pointed out the 15ft fence probably made the already small castle look even smaller but I am sure once they are finished it will look amazing and I will definitely be back to see for myself! 2) Despite the Disney Corporation priding themselves in magic and customer service I was a disappointed to not see this fully reflected in this park. Overall customer service was lacking in Hong Kong as a whole and I understand culturally it is a different world, but I was constantly disappointed in the rudeness I experienced during my trip and think it something that needs to be worked on at this park in order to keep in with the Disney magic."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element.

"626862391,5,2018-10,Australia,""Our first Disneyland and there were rides for 10 and 12 year old. Entry took 50 minutes when arriving at 10, but straight through the second day at 4!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
626830488,5,2018-10,Australia,I   d read all the reviews before going and a lot were disappointed about it being small. Went with an open mind as we   ve been to both Disneyland and Disney world in the USA before. We had a lovely day as adults. Got around the park in a day. Most rides were between a 15 30 wait in line which was manageable. We didn   t watch any of the shows except the Halloween street parade at 4:30pm (which didn   t disappoint) and didn   t line up for character photos so the Day was very smooth. Has all the charm of the original park and well worth the visit for a Disney fan.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"626390967,5,2018-10,Australia,""Disneyland in Hong Kong is a Fabulous opportunity for Australasia to experience the joys of a Magical World away from bars, clubs and casinos! It is where Adults can be kids and kids to be thrilled by the magic. Firstly, if you are not staying in the Disney resort it is wise to buy your tickets online, also include your meal in the ticket as it is easier and cheaper. The package also includes a drink or ice cream AND a $50 voucher to spend at the Disney shop.We arrived close to opening time to beat the crowds but also remember the grand parade and fireworks are late evening, so check the show times and choose your arrival time accordingly. There is only one train connection in and out of Disneyland, don't stress about missing it as it runs every 10 mins etc. Entry during non peak season is quick, but beware bags are checked and no picnics, outside food or big drinks allowed.Once, inside the FUN begins, grab a map, review show times then run amok. If you are in a big family group like we were, separate and meet up when you  bump  into each other or at a arranged time as not every ride is suitable for everyone.The outer restaurants are quieter and are like food markets, make sure you take your voucher to validate if applicable.Queues for rides in October wasn't to long a wait between 5   25 mins, depends on type of ride as the more fast action rides went quicker as little kids could not go on them. The Dumbo ride was the best, simple BUT Fun. If you want the adrenalin rush then the Star Wars ride and the old Cabin Rail ride will do the trick. Skip the Halloween walk through journey, it's in Chinese with only one character speaking English. The  It's a Small World After All  ride in Fantasyland is so CUTE!Time flies and in no time the day ends as everyone is tired and themed park out.tyThanks to the Security staff who let our devastated 6 year old nephew re enter at the exit gate with his parents to search for his Disney cap he had left behind while posing for a photo just before exiting. By magic, no one picked it up and it was found where he had left it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

626016783,5,2018-10,Indonesia,Disneyland is must go place when you come to Hongkong. Since i was a kid i always dream to coming to Disneyland! It was an amazing experience! There are so many attraction there and you must take picture with Disney's character at the main street. It's a must! Wait until night and you can see Disney's parade at main street too. Food is okay but can be a lil bit expensive. But hey come on! Enjoy your dream holiday :D ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"625739774,4,2018-10,Hong Kong,""If you plan to watch the parade, do make sure you grab good position at main street, especially the straight lane.   Else you might missed some part of it.

"625623706,4,2018-10,India,""Very well organised place, good fun to spend a day with kids. If you plan well, can enjoy all the shows in a day's trip. However, timings for meeting various characters should be increased, especially if the crowds are large."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"625303443,4,2018-10,India,""We took a 2 day ticket as we were not sure with one day it can all be covered. The first day, we reached by 10 AM and being a weekday it was not very crowded. Its Halloween time and the place had parades and decorations for Halloween. Started with start trek and iron man rides and it was good. Remember, these rides are not as thrilling as the Universal studio and intended for young children (this is Disney!) Then proceeded to the shows and realized that shows get full if you don't reach early. The Moana show had very little seating and the security staff especially one male was kind of rude to people who were walking around. I guess they need to remember that they are not police and kids come with a lot of hope to see this. Not all staff are very fluent in English and when they speak in English they sound rather rude. (Don't stand here, I DON'T know, Move away! etc are the words you hear). Some of them really need a lesson on being 'polite while being assertive'.The food options as written by many others are disappointing for people who do not eat pork and beef, there are very few chicken options. We tried the Asian cuisine restaurants and they are very average when it comes to quality of food. For vegetarians, it's a day of fasting!! (kidding, but it is almost true).If you book from Disney site, you get $15 x2 coupons. The main street store refused to take more than one coupon for a transaction, I argued and they called the manager who confirmed the rule!   one coupon per transaction. But to my surprise on the second day of my visit another store inside (star trek or the fantasy land one) accepted 2 coupons on my wife's ticket. Surprising. Again I think its English language proficiency that is the culprit. Unpleasant experience.The parades were excellent, especially the 8 PM Halloween parade. Shows were also really good and I guess more than rides these are the things you shouldn't miss while in Disneyland.The second day was a Saturday and we could clearly see the difference in the crowd. It was crowded from 10 AM itself. We had only a few stuff pending and finished everything by lunchtime. Overall, it was a 1 and a half day visit and in my opinion, if you are not so particular about missing out a couple of rides you can cover this park in 1 Day itself   try to visit on a weekday.  MTR is connected to the park and transportation to the city is very easy.   There was no free Wi FI  The HongKong Disneyland app on Android can give you details of the shows. It just keeps crashing often on my Samsung phone but for a day it's manageable.  No food or drink allowed to be carried inside, Its mentioned everywhere but I still saw people getting caught in the security and wasting time in disposing off.  Many rides and attractions can be closed for public on a certain day due to 'private' events, details are updated on daily basis on the website and app. Check beforehand and plan.  You should be going at least 20 mins early for the shows, they get filled up fast."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
625141875,5,2018-10,Australia,I have been to Disneyland in Los Angeles so I can only compare the Hong Kong site to the original. I enjoyed this Disneyland very much. The staff were always friendly and helpful. We had a mix up with our pre bought tickets and they went out of their way to help us resolve the issue even offering us express passes to some of the popular rides. Having been there in October they had a Halloween theme throughout the park and line ups to rides were not long as it was out of the holiday season for Hong Kong residents. They were giving away lots of stickers and lollies in the Halloween themed garden where kids could make up small baskets to go trick or treating. This was all free. Food is standard theme park menu items. We had burgers and fries which was decent enough.The theme park is near the airport direction and it cost us approx $50AUD each way from our hotel in Mong Kok via Uber (we had 6 people and needed a large van).There is also complimentary wi fi throughout the park.Its a long and tiring day when you are there from 10:30am until 8:30pm at night but it is worth it to see all the parades as well as the rides and features. I recommend to attend over two days as we didn't get to see all the themed sections in the first day. The kids loved it and so did us adults.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
625139064,4,2018-10,Philippines,Disneyland Hong Kong is small compared to other Disneyland we visited. When we visited it wasn't that clean. Leaves from the trees are scattered in the alley. The pavement construction was not sophisticated too. The pros is that you can roam the entire Disneyland in one day for it wasn't that big.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"625065180,3,2018-1,Singapore,""My first time at a Disneyland was rather disappointing";" the queues were terribly long, the food was massively overpriced, and the rides were hardly thrilling. I supposed this park is catered mostly towards touristy families with young children, because there are much better things to do in Hong Kong and better cheaper theme parks such as Ocean Park. My advice is to go ahead to HK Disneyland if you are travelling with children or the elderly and have quite a bit of money to spare as it is a small theme park with expensive food and souvenirs but is extremely tourist friendly. If not, explore Hong Kong in its authenticity instead!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
624884437,2,2018-5,United States,The Disneyland here is way too commercialized   too many stores than rides compared to the ones in US!My brother did not enjoy it since the ultimate night show was cancelled & that was not announced in their website!It was a big disappointment for my supposed to be treat!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
624857744,4,2018-9,Australia,Compared to Disneyland In California this Park is smaller but in saying this it is still a memorable and enjoying experience. The only complaint we had was that it rained most of the day but it didn't detract from the great time we had,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"624808403,5,2018-10,Australia,""By comparison to LA , this Disneyland is not so intimidating and bug. We spent 2 days and still did not see everything.

"624722169,4,2018-6,Indonesia,""I love Disney. I can say that I am Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse biggest fan. But I still can't get the idea of spending 2 3 days of your holidays in Disneyland. For that reason, I think the size of the area of HK Disneyland is perfect. It might be slightly smaller than other Disneylands, but for some people who does not want to spend their times in Disneyland (just like me), this place is great. I came to this place in June, when it was 32degrees celsius in HK. If I have to spend my whole day in Disneyland under the crazy sun of HK, I don't think I would make it. Lol. So it might be a good idea not to have a bigger area of Disneyland in 2 seasonal countries such as HK. Furthermore, you still can have all of the favourite rides and attractions. So, overall...i give it 4 stars. Highly recommended if you want to have Disneyland experience but unwilling to spend more than 1 day trip."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"624611488,4,2018-10,Thailand,""Best get in early as possible though, crowd & queueslow in the morning an as the day progresses obviously the queue time extends.I would start at Tomorrow Land and work your way around the park in a anti clockwise direction as I believe the rides are better and if you run out of time you haven't missed out on too much. Take something to eat in a back pack if with a young family as eating at the park is very expensive. All in all a great day with good family memories forever."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"624203838,5,2018-9,Singapore,""A day in Disneyland has always been magical. When me and my friends reached Sunny Bay Station to get to Disneyland Resort, we were greeted by a Disney themed train with Mickey shaped windows. Do bring along an umbrella or poncho just in case it rains and there is no shelter. Whether you are with a family of friends, you will enjoy the experience. Most rides cater to children but there are roller coasters and thrilling rides at Toy Story section. There is 2 halal certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer's Club for muslim travellers. Do look out for the parades as kids will love it. Wear comfortable outfit and shoes if possible as the place is damn huge and require lots of walking. Highly recommended for all ages."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"624183786,2,2018-10,Australia,""When it comes to Disney, you expect wonderful things, but we were very disappointed with our overall experience here on our recent visit. The park is very small and doesn't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesn't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim. I wouldn't recommend visiting this theme park. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
624135894,3,2018-9,United Arab Emirates,Visiting Disneyland is dream for Kids & adults as well. We visited earlier in Paris but first time for my boy. The Disney train is really really lovely.

We went the day after the clean up from the typhoon   I was very impressed with their efficiency! We had a fabulous time. The baby had fun on  it's a small world after all  boat ride, the  Winnie the Pooh  train ride and the  Incredibles  ride. It was easy to get around with a stroller (compared to the rest of HK which isn't stroller friendly), had decent food options for babies at the cafe, decent baby change and breastfeeding facilities were available and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't as large as the other Disneylands so it was easier to see all the entertainment. As we were leaving for the night, they put on a special Halloween parade. It is easy to get to HK Disneyland via the metro but you do need to change at least once on the metro if your hotel is on another HK island e.g. Kowloon. It is also close to the cable car ride at Ngong Ping so if there is time and energy, I would recommend doing the two together on the day. See Ngong Ping first and take the cable car for a great view of the beauty of HK and then take the metro to Disneyland and enjoy the rest of the day and evening there."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"623339896,5,2018-9,South Korea,""Smaller than the original Disneyland in Anaheim, but even with its compact nature it packs a day full of fun. We got super lucky on our day, it wasn   t so crowded so my friends and I managed to do every single thing, except the little kids rides. There are a few unique rides and HKD, like mystic manor and the new iron man ride, which will give you bragging rights as they aren   t at other parks, but then standards like a Star Wars version of space mountain, it   s a small world, and my personal favorite the jungle cruise. As to shows, go see them all. They were so much fun and amazing. Even some shows are in multiple languages at once, it only adds to the charm. Lion King was my favorite. And the parades, especially the Villains parade at night was really fantastic. The food was also good and not unreasonable considering HK prices. And if you want special stickers be sure to ask cat members for help or questions and then you may get one. I got three. Over all amazing fun day. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"623192942,4,2018-9,Canada,""While not nearly as robust as it   s Japanese, French and American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland has its charms. The number one perk: the crowds. I have never seen crowds so light at a Disney park. Nearly all rides were walk on the entire day     even the fantastic Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Minecars and Hyperspace Mountain. The downside to the low crowds: many rides, shops and food vendors all had off hours (with some of the latter not opening at all). But the food we did have was great, the people were friendly and it was actually kind of nice not to have to rush through the relatively small park.

Food was great, very large serves, food vouchers with our entrance tickets were a good option and even if you choose a meal over the limit of the voucher value, you can paid the difference. The park itself might be smaller than most of the other parks around the world, but still you have all of the favorite rides and areas, we loved every minute of it.

622786289,4,2018-10,Australia,We loved the experience and thought the rides were excellent. We stayed at Hotel Disneyland which I would highly recommend.Try to come in winter as the heat was almost unbearable during the middle of the day especially with 45 min queues due to Golden Week.

"622768816,5,2018-10,New Zealand,""Hong Kong Disneyland was the third Disney experience for my fianc  e and me after LA and Paris.It   s smaller than the other Disneylands, and could probably be done in one day, but we opted to pay the tiny bit more for a second day, and ended up very pleased with that decision as we felt we got a lot of payback out of doing rides multiple times. Hong Kong Disneyland seem really good at making the rides effective even if you   ve done them a lot before. Mystic Manor is probably the best example, the details and special effects are incredible, we were noticing new things the fifth time we did it.The Jungle Cruise is also great   we did it four times   with the guides genuinely funny and a great action packed circuit. One of the zebras was missing an ear though.It is the least impressive Space Mountain we have seen yet but still worth doing a few times. The cheap Star Wars overlay does not work, and you can see too much of the track and rigging inside   it really should be blacked out, I thought that was the point.We highly recommend the Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars, we really like it how they did it in their own style rather than just mimic Big Thunder Mountain.Generally the crowds are well behaved with very little queue jumping.We were there on a Thursday and Friday   the park got really busy in the afternoon so I would recommend doing the big attractions in the morning or at the end   in the last hour we were able to walk on to It   s a small world, Jungle cruise, and Grizzly Mine carts without any queue.I would also suggest doing Fantasyland as soon as the park opens   we did five rides in the first hour, which would have been impossible later in the day.The teacups here are the fastest we have experienced and the rides are overall fairly gentle on the head and neck but still a lot of fun. We didn   t really like the Disneyland Railroad (not much to see   this seems pointless outside of LA) and the Iron Man simulator, which looked suspiciously similar to Star Tours.Throughout Disneyland, the cast are not as exuberant as in LA and generally don   t add to the experience, apart from on the Jungle Cruise. But they are helpful and polite and most seem to speak enough English for us to not have to worry. The only time where our our experience was marred by our lack of any Chinese language was the seasonal walkthrough based on the Nightmare before Christmas. There were 5 or 6 sections, all but one were entirely delivered by characters speaking Chinese only, so we were not really able to follow it. Visually it was very impressive but they should have warned guests that they would not understand it if they didn   t speak Chinese because this was the only thing in the park not with no English and it had one of the biggest wait times.I would recommend that Disney seriously considers restricting people from using big sun umbrellas. The Fairy Tale Forest was pointless because people just stand with their umbrellas blocking everyone   s view.Overall the park is probably not as aesthetically impressive as LA or Paris but it still feels very Disney. One area where they excel is how they light up the park at night   it looks great.So going in we though it might not have the genuine Disney feel due to it being very small, but this turned out to not be a problem at all. We also noticed far less annoying stroller parking everywhere than in LA and far less smoking than in France. The food had very good Disney theming. We got our Disney fix and we would recommend it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"622336927,5,2018-7,Philippines,""Having the ability to go to any Disneyland Resort has been a life long dream for our family. Hong Kong DisneyLand is a perfect place to spend time with your family or friends. It's offers a wide variety of experiences, from gastronomical aspects, and imaginative concepts that triggers happiness as you connect to your inner child. The rides are all in pristine condition. And the food has good quality into them. I would definitely recommend Disneyland to anyone I know for the rest of my life. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"621997514,4,2018-10,Canada,""My partner and I love Disney so we were always going to go to Disneyland Hong Kong when we saw there was one. In the last few years, we have checked out LA and Paris versions together. The park was great, alot better than expected and a nice size, meaning you could get around all the attractions if you spent the whole day there. The rides were longer than some of the other parks we have visited recently. Our only drawback, came from the shows on offer. The Lion King show was a spectacle to watch, with it being all singing and dancing, however, the songs didn   t sound the same, with varying notes used by the performers. We also went to the Moana show, expecting to see and hear some of the great music, but this time there was no music at all involved. Maybe it is hard to find performers at the right ability, but it is a slight area of improvement, if I was being picky. Overall, it was a great day out and I would highly recommend it, Tip   It   s obviously very hot, so make sure you take lots of water with you, as it   s fairly expensive in the park. Tip   We went on a Tuesday, hoping it would be quiet but was very busy, possibly as it was the day after China Day, so try go on a slower day to get around everything.

621805683,4,2018-10,Australia,Each Disney park has it's uniqueness. Get there early to buy your tickets and line up. Catch MTR to Sunny Bay and change trains to the Disneyland resort line. It's the heat that exhausts you so take plenty of sun protection and pop into the shops to cool down. I don't recommend taking toddlers to any theme parks as there is very little for them to do and it is a realy long day. The staff are friendly and most speak English. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"621719662,5,2018-9,India,""Luckily i had kept Disneyland stay for the end of my family trip. The moment one enters the sprawling premises, one realises that only an American venture can be so elaborate, high tech & beautiful. With nothing much to do for a family visiting Hong Kong (in terms of activities involving kids), Disneyland more than made up for it. Built like a fairy  fantasy land with separate sections, one ideally needs 2 full days to be able to enjoy everything. Crowded like mad, there are long queues even for getting snaps clicked with disney characters all over. The 3 parades in a day were a spectacle to watch esp the end of the day as it was Halloween Theme in place. However, my son was hugely disappointed as he totally missed out on doing  Adventure Land  & still regrets it. Fault wasnt ours as we spaced out everything well after finding out shut down time from staff  site who told us it was 2000h. however, when we reached Adventure Land at about 1915h with 45mins to spare, it had totally shut down & nobody could explain as to why as all other sections were still open. Also, we had lost about an hour in the morning view heavy rains. But the authorities wouldnt allow us even limited entry of an hour into the Adventure Land the next day. that i personally feel was highly unprofessional & insensitive as THEY had shut down the section way before closing time. My son still feels miserable when he talks about the trip. So ideally, stay inside for 2 nights   just the right amount of stay. Its worth every penny"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was very hot though so I would probably recommend going during the cooler months, but then you might have to queue up for rides. Because of the typhoon there were a few rides that were closed. Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too. Only took our 1yr old on the    It   s A Small World    ride but my 9yr old nephew went on pretty much all the rides. Spent heaps on merchandise too!

I was running and lowkey screaming when we got to the entrance arch. HAHA. A whole day is required to enjoy all the rides. We went there a little over lunch and we missed some. Lines were already forgiving during our trip since we went there on a Saturday in September, not a popular time to visit since blogs say it's already starting to rain in HK during September. Luckily, it was sunny during that time. And we only waited in line for an average of 10 minutes, I guess. Lucky, right?? Food will cost you a lot so it's better to eat outside and come with a full stomach. But if it cannot be avoided, there are food stalls inside. The sausages at Toy Story Land were good. !!!!DO NOT MISS THE HYPERSPACE MOUNTAIN RIDE AT TOMORROWLAND!!!! SO INTENSE!!!! The Small World ride was very cute and chill and relaxing, you should try that too. Since January 2018, there were no more fireworks display to close the day. To compensate, they do character parades three times a day. Because of this, we were not able to take photos with the characters (we prioritized the rides hehe) since no longer entertain photo ops at 5 PM, because the staff will be getting ready for the closing parade.

Take advantage of the fast pass system. If your ticket is crumpled or broken and the machine won   t accept it, there is a small inconspicuous button on the back of the fastpass machine that will print a fast pass ticket for you.

We were too late to get our Mickey and Minnie picture. The food voucher was well worth it. Food portion was large. Drinks are expensive but you must stay well hydrated for the amount of walking that is done. We did not use the fast pass as the park was not very busy.

It ended so randomly after 5 walk throughs and majority in cantonese only (4 out of 5) On top of all we hardly queued at all the rides and waited the longest to go to this! 45 minutes. Whoever came up with the walk through story needs to sort out the    ending    of it. The actors tress were great though especially Sally the Rag Doll (shes really amazing from her make up to her voice) Jack was of course good and the themed rooms and decoration. But really got to pay attention from the start to end! Ending really impacts the guests impression too and our whole group of 12 15? were like wtf at the end.

People avoided eye contact, only approached us at the dining cafe when we we're signaling for help, and some cast members were on their cell phones! We we're trying to buy storm trooper magnets and we had to wait for someone to look up from their phone and ring us up. The roller coasters are fun and there were no lines it being a Wednesday. Super clean bathrooms and park. Toy story land is small but the rides are good for kids. They decorated for Halloween so it was enjoyable to see.

The various    lands    clean and slick, though staff in many are pretty slow to make things happen. Rides including roller coasters are fun and there is plenty for every age or level of    adventure    tolerance. Integration of Star Wars and Marvel themes are good, as is Toy Story Park area and Grizzly Gulch. Have to say that after a day I was theme parked out, but I can see that people that love Disney or theme parks could get far more out of it than me and over a couple of days.

Waiting time for each ride is around 10 15 minutes (weekends). See if there is a FASTPASS distribution sign near the entrance of the attraction you want to ride. Cartoon characters too have resting time therefore, there's a possibility of missing out on few.

620201737,4,2018-9,Taiwan,Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing. We took the MTR from Kowloon to HK Disneyland and the trains are adorable. The Mickey Mouse windows and then the various statues of Disney characters were so fun to see. We arrived before the park opened and got to watch a family open the park. This family the mom was cutely dressed and the kids were in different Halloween costumes and they were picked to open up Disney. It was SO adorable. Right now Disneyland is decorated all for Halloween and there is an area for the Villians to be out and planning. The music is a variety of Halloween music. Mickey and Minnie mouse were dressed for Halloween. Here is my opinion....HK Disneyland is a great place to go. If you want to go on the rides as long as you are going during a peak time (which I'm not sure when that would be    we went during the Moon Festival) but for most rides we waited no more than 20 minutes. However meeting the characters could ranges from waiting for 5 minutes or you could be waiting for over an 1 hour.

"619461372,4,2018-7,United States,""This may be the most beautiful of the Disneylands I've visited (LA, Orlando, Shanghai and Hong Kong) but it has the least to offer of them. We stayed and I recommend staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and were given paper FASTPASSes we could use on Ironman Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, and Mickey's PhilharMagic (which we didn't see as we have seen it numerous times in WDW). You get a certain number of FP for each person per night you stay based on your level of room. We stayed in a Kingdom Club Room and received 4 passes per night per person so we had 16 passes as we stayed four nights for 5 attractions. I threw some away and gave some away because it was simply too many for such a small park to even want to ride those same five attractions that many times! But I highly recommend this for at least one night. Staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel also gets you into Mickey and the Wondrous Book's first show in first which we did. We were still able to get a FASTPASS for Winnie the Pooh in the park as well and used a VIP tour to do all the rest of the rides skipping the line and for a private viewing area of the nighttime parade (which we didn't need as it wasn't crowded compared to US park standards even in July and we watched the parade from the upstairs of the RR station on Main Street with no one around us and a superb view). We were able to ride things multiples times and see all shows we don't have in our American parks. We had a great time but there is far less to do here and it does not require more than a day if you plan correctly. They don't have a lot of newer amazing attractions like Shanghai did and it was extremely hot in July so I'm only giving it four stars."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

They recovered from the typhoon rather quickly. Most everything was open and you would never know the typhoon passed through here. The Ironman Experience is cheesy. It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly. It was funny to see one of the drummers with a body suit to make him look tanned with Maori tattoos.The parade had the normal characters Toy Story, Lilo & Stitch, etc. Seemed shorter than the American version.Overall, this little Disney is entertaining for the children and maybe teenagers.

The cast are attentive and in character, the facilities are world class and the rides continually met Disney   s high standards. Our kids always love it, and as they get older, find new aspects of the park to love. Grisly gulch and mystic manor have climbed to the TOP of their list as favourite rides, and Groot is the new favourite character.

One of the good things about the HK Disneyland is that you don   t have to walk a long way to get to each attraction as the park is not big. Compared to those in other cities such as the Disneyworld in Florida, for a slow walker like me, it   s pretty tiring to walk to each attraction, though there are some means of transport that I could use, for example the bus.And because it   s small, visitors can easily explore the whole park in just one day, giving them more time to see other beautiful places in HK.And for those visitors who like Chinese food, don   t forget to try the Plaza Inn, delicious chicken and suckling pig.

But the best part for me are the shows we watched   Feast of the Lion King, Mickey's Philharmonic Theater and Storybook. It was like going back to my childhood days. So nostalgic, specially for a Disney fan like me. The parade was the main highlight for me which I totally enjoyed. One of the things I was disappointed about is that there were no fireworks because Sleeping Beauty castle was closed for renovation. I also did not get to see as much Disney characters, maybe because it was raining? Lastly, the food is pricey and in small portions too. But overall, it was a memorable and fun visit!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"618522267,4,2018-9,United Arab Emirates,""My family enjoyed our trip in Disney HK. It is really the happiest place. As an adult it reminds me of my childhood days. There is one staff who is very accommodating, he is the guard standing in the entrance near the jungle river, although I forgot to take note of his name. We had our lunch in Starliner, unfortunately my family did not enjoy the food. I would recommend the Royal Banquet Hall where we enjoyed our dinner. A variety of foods to choose from and the serving was very satisfying. My son enjoyed the hyperspace mountain. While I enjoyed the jungle river a lot.

"618076912,1,2018-9,Philippines,""Its not the fault of Disney that such a bad typhoon storm hit and closed and disrupted operations. It is their fault and responsibility in how they handle the ensuing customer issues.When we explained to Mr.Dominic Chanat the Hong Kong Disneyland Reservation Center that we travelled far with our kids, paid for plane tickets, paid hotel, etc and bought silver passes to the park and had limited time he didnt seem to care. The park was closed during our stay for one day and many things in the park were not running or closed. All we asked was to be able to use our passes on Saturday to make up for the closed day and the other problems as we leave Sunday.He gave us the magical template answer with a NO, passes cant be used on Saturday with no consideration. Greed before customer concern is how they responded to the aftermath of the storm.The park is currently in disarray and best to avoid until they get the place fixed up and can ensure us that all the attractions have been inspected for safety due to storm damage that may compromise safety."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the place is clean, and for Muslim tourists, you dont have to worry about getting Halal food and Musollah, they provide and cater for you. We do have fun in Mystic Manor, Grizzly grunch and Space mountain. One day is enough for you to look around and ride everything plus to shop and the parade. But, do go there during weekdays, the queue will not take long, as maximum will get you only 10 minutes per ride. We did enjoy anyway. But to take photos with the icons, you have to queue as they have only specific spot just for photography. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The park officially opened at 10am but they opened the gates at 9.30 and allowed access to Main Street. We visited on a weekend and although busy we were still able to go on all the rides. We didn't watch the main parade but did see the Pixar Water Street Party which was great fun and we all got completely soaked. As for food we pre purchased the 3 in 1 offer from Klook, this allowed to eat in a variety of restaurants and allowed us one main course and and a drink for lunch must be eaten before 4pm and a main course and drink for dinner and that could only be eaten after 4.30pm. We also could take our pick of a ice cream or popcorn from one of the vendor carts.

A handful of good rides for adults makes it enjoyable. Don   t expect many thrill seeking rides here. The layout of the park and the themed detail that goes into the attraction is fantastic. A one day pass is all that is needed to get around to all the attractions. Only disappointment was the lack of food stalls and the lack of variety. Many stalls were closed. Kids had hotdogs which did not seem fresh. The 1.30pm parade was fantastic and a must see for all ages. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This park is much smaller and rides are similar, maybe with a different name, but similar to whats in Orlando. One big difference was Toy Story land, which reminded me of Hollywood Studios. These rides we hadn't seen before and they were super fun, even for an 11 and 13 year old. The lines in August were what you'd expect, most 45 minutes  if not more. We stayed at Disney property and were given what was basically fast passes for some of the rides.

If you expect western style junk food, think again, this was worse. The rides were good. Queue discipline was at times bad with ignorant people shoving their kids past us and when their kids cried out that the adults couldn't get by to join them, we reluctantly let them through too. The fairytale castle, tiny as it is was behind hoardings as I guess they were working to add extra magic with the diggers that were there. Go to Ocean Park instead."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"615022892,4,2018-3,Australia,""We went with our 2 year old and found HK Disneyland was great. We wished that we had booked a night at their hotel (despite it costing more than our hotel back in Sai Yin Pun). It would have meant that we could spend more time at Disneyland and get to stay for the fireworks at night. We went on a relatively quiet day, but the lines were still too long to bother getting photos with the characters that made random appearances throughout the day. Lines were good for the rides that were age appropriate for our 2 year old and we still managed to spend the whole day there, but not see everything. If we had another opportunity to go back, we would invest the few extra dollars to stay at the Disneyland hotel and therefore spend more time there. Cost is to be expected going to a theme park, and they had a lot of Chinese food available for lunch. Either that or expensive Mickey Mouse shaped waffles. The train that takes you to Disneyland from Sunny Bay was Disney themed and pretty cool.

We had a great time here, from the minute we got on the Disney Train, all the way till we left. It was really hot, and there is not much shelter, so you'll have to find respite in rides and shops. There are not that many rides here, and it's probably something you can do in 1 2 days at a leisurely pace, especially if it's not busy (there weren't any rides that had longer than 15 minutes wait when we went on a weekday).There are some unique features of this park  Mystic Manor, and some characters who we have never met before, like Cookie (friend of Duffy). Lilo is also here.The food here is expensive, and there is less variety than the US. No dedicated ice cream store, only one churro cart, etc..With little crowds, this was quite a good experience for us. The castle is small, but they're upgrading.

614892974,4,2018-7,Saudi Arabia,A nice place to visit with the family especially if they are early teens or younger. We got a very good deal through Air Asia with 20% off which made it even better. It is better to buy the meal deal from the site as that is economical compared to buying it individually provided of course if you are going to use for both lunch and dinner. Only issue is if it rains or signs of inclement weather then a lot of rides are stopped which could spoil your day and crowding at all indoor rides,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
614741477,5,2018-4,Singapore,A good place for adult and children. Had a good fun time roaming around Disneyland and taking rides.

With special Disney MTR trains, a manicured Station, a grand sign leading up to the park, and a fountain with Mickey surfing above Moby Dick with all his friends watching.We walked straight to the gate queues having bought our tickets (from Klook) and printed them of as instructed. Unfortunately not everyone had done so, and there was chaos as people tried to find get their QR codes to work from their phones as they held up the every increasing line. The park opened at 10am, but no rides were open until 10.30. Even then not all. Sleeping Beauty   s Castle is under refurbishment, so can   t be seen properly or accessed. We rode and enjoyed The Iron Man experience which was a simulation ride, after getting fast passes for Space Mountain. The Jungle Cruise was ok, with queues for the 3 different languages. Don   t be fooled by the short English queue. After riding Space Mountain, we watched the Jedi Training. They catered well again for the different languages using them all. The kids were great.Unfortunately after that the heavens opened, and it poured with rain. There didn   t appear to be enough places for people to shelter, in regards to indoor rides or covered areas.

It can be completed well within 1 day as I feel that unless you will feel obligated to visit each n every attraction, there is no need to spend 2 days here. Otherwise, the place is beautiful, food is great, costly of course. The 4D effect in theatre experience of Iron Man was well created. But the post sunset fireworks were an absolute visual delight and you need to stay back till 7:30 pm to make your visit feel complete. Easy to commute to Disneyland by MTR: East Tsim Sha Tsui         Nam Cheong         Sunny Bay         Disneyland. Change lines at the above mentioned stations and you shud be in Disneyland in 40 mins from Tsim Sha Tsui. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
611423833,3,2018-8,Singapore,August is a rainy season in Hk so prepare for umbrella or rain coat.Get adv online tickets  either printed out on paper or QR code on your phone. You can bet the line a little.The attraction is the same as elsewhere but some of the parks are under renovation. E.g. you can't get a good view of the Disney castles due to reno.The hourly shows are in Cantonese except folks songs in English.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"611414876,4,2017-10,Hong Kong,""I am barely qualified to gauge the quality of this or any other Disneyland: I don't have kids, and have not been to a Disney theme park since the 1980s. But Ladyfriend and I decided not long after we moved here to spend the weekend on Lantau, and so here we are. And to be frank, I enjoyed HK Disneyland. It's really small, as I am sure other reviewers have mentioned, which means that it's doable in two or three hours (maybe longer if you have kids?), and although it is missing (m)any of the thrill rides that other Disney properties feature (you'll have to go to Ocean Park for that...), it's a nice way to spend an afternoon.I'm not going to explain what Disneyland is. But I do have some tips.   Go on a weekday. I have never been on a weekend, but am sure it gets crowded. We didn't hit a single line on a Tuesday  They don't start serving booze until early evening. I don't know what my advice is on this front other than maybe  go later,  but I will say a propos of nothing that there is very little stopping one from hitting the 7 11 beforehand and bringing some roadies.  Lunch options are few, so same as above, although once you're in it's definitely not as expensive as other Disney parks in terms of food. There's a multinational, cafeteria style restaurant that is not great, but certainly gets the job done is doesn't break the bank.Note: I shouldn't have to even write this, but if you are visiting HK and looking for an  authentic  HK experience, do NOT go to Disneyland. Stick to the main island and to Kowloon, where there are a million awesome things to do and see. But if you have kids, or like rides, or need to check this Disney experience off of your bucket list, or have some sort of personal Disney thing such that you are all but mandated by your therapist or something to spend as much time as possible in the happiest place on earth, I won't try to dissuade you. Again, it's small enough that you can spend the morning doing actual HK stuff, and then spend the afternoon here, or vice versa. It's also pretty close to the action";" if you're taking public, expect about a 90 minute ride from Central, but the nice thing is that Disneyland has a dedicated MTR line, complete with Mickey's head shaped windows and straps.Finally, here are the rides you want to go on, at least as an adult, as agreed upon by Ladyfriend and myself:1. Hyperspace Mountain (a very small scale Star Wars themed ride that piggy backs on the Space Mountain concept). It's less scary than an actual roller coaster, but there are some stomach drops. If I were big brothering a kid who was very frightened of roller coasters, I would make him go on this to build his confidence. There are a couple of cool SW tie ins as well.2. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. It's all there in the name, and it's a fun little ride.3. RC Racer. This is their version of the big, swinging pirate ship ride that many of us grew up with. Stomach drops galore.4. Toy Soldier Parachute Drop. Your bench seat is hoisted way up high (affording one of the best views all day), and then... you drop. 5. Iron Man Experience. This is a VR experience that is several notches above seeing an action film in 4DX. It's OK for adults, but I suspect elementary aged kids would love it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

You don't have to walk as far to get where you are going. The lines or rides are much shorter than the other Disneylands I have been too. My only complaint is that it was so hot there that I sweated so much it made my shorts look as if I had wet myself. On that nite I would advise you all to visit there during the winter. The staff there was helpful at all times. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"610859659,5,2018-8,United Kingdom,""I loved this Disney because it is not too big and can be visited in one day. The night parade was cancelled at the 11th hour due to thunderstorm which was a shame. The ticket prices were reasonably priced but food, drinks and balloons etc were extortionate prices. A balloon was $150 which I thought was ridiculous. Queues were reasonable for rides. The most we queued was 40 minutes for the rollercoaster. All others were under 30 minutes. Using the app was helpful to see queue times."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"609410538,4,2018-8,Australia,""You'll need stamina and patience but this is a good place to spend 10  hours with your kids, there are plenty of great attractions and everything is don't to a high quality. however like all Disneylands, wait times can be long   especially to meet get photo with characters... allow at least 30 min per character so get your kids to choose carefully otherwise you'll pay a fortune to spend the day getting a few photos. Best Things:1. Rides and attractions are great, as are shows like Lion King. 2. Everything is clean and well maintained.3. Its so easy to get to and from with the MTR (train) or taxisWorst Things:1. Food is very expensive and wait times can be very long (eg 30  minutes for McDonalds!) for pretty basic fare. 2. Wait times for photos with Disney characters are very long, some active 'people management' should be employed to make it 15 seconds per photo opportunity then move on! 3. Guest Relations are almost useless   dont expect help or understanding from them and they don't care if your kids are howling and your are distressed."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Disneyland did not disappoint us. The park is beautifully decorated. The rides and entertainment are amazing. We went there on December and it wasn't even cold. So don't wear heavy clothes. I almost fainted of heat. Good thing I brought an extra blouse. They have great restaurants around. We tried this Chinese Restaurant that offers very big bowl of noodle soup. It's good for 2 persons I guess. But we ordered one each. So we did not finish it. The rides are just very... cute. Really for kids. No life threatening rides which some people enjoy.

609356988,5,2018-8,United States,I went to HK Disneyland from Wanchai on a rainy Friday afternoon. It was easy to get to on the MTR. The park was not too crowded and lines were fairly short. For some reason the Jungle Cruise line was longer than any other I waited for! Lucky for me they had a line for English speaking and the    river guide    spoke in clear English. Which is more than could be said for the train conductor whose English was indistinguishable from her Chinese. The castle was under construction but I was informed of that before I paid. I had a wonderful afternoon and four hours was plenty. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traveling with 3 young kids was fairly easy and smooth.Having visited most of the Disney parks we had quite high expectations for this park, and they were met. As soon as you board the Disney train from sunny bay station you can see and feel that there was no expenses spared. We visited on a Saturday and it was busy but not overcrowded.At the time not all the rides open and there were a few parts under construction or renovation including the main castle.Average wait time for the characters was about 1hr. Average queue time for kids rides was about 30mins.We opted for the 3 in 1 meal pass which worked out best for us.Our lunch meal was at royal banquet hall which was surprisingly very good, considering it was theme park food. And dinner was at Clopin's Festival of Foods, and this was amazing! Coming from Stockholm, I have to admit that the food we got from this restaurant was better than anything I   ve had in sweden.

I've been to all the Disney theme parks and I must say this definitely takes the Chinese culture and melds it in with the traditional Disney experience. They offer grilled squid as a snack! Toy Story Land is a definitely Must See... YOU MUST go on the Mystic Manor ride! It's so much fun and offers a different vision of the Haunted Mansion ride! Another ride you must do is the Iron Man Experience which is similar to Disneyland's Star Tour's ride, except it takes you to Stark Expo where Hydra starts causing mayhem and Tony Stark saves the day! Definitely a totally different ride from anywhere else and totally worth the wait! I'd also suggest staying here if you have the chance!

Mystic Point was a great addition to the park as was Hyperspace Mountain. Strange hours   opening at 10 and closing at 9pm. Also, the train stopped at 6pm which was super disappointing! Why?? Really overall it seemed like a money grab and while the day was enjoyable, as someone in our party (who is a HUGE Disney fan) commented, the place  Is missing the magic . And I agree.

Best rides to go on: Hyperspace Mountain (like Space Mountain in the US, but Star Wars themed), Mystic Manor (the Hong Kong answer to the Haunted Mansion), and Big Grizzly Mountain   truly the best surprise of the three!

"602578967,4,2018-7,Australia,""Perhaps it was my timing but HK Disneyland was missing something this time around. Lots of new and current characters abound but the land area hasn't increased to accommodate the extra additions. Many of the old favorites were missing this time   or perhaps they are no longer there! There does not appear to be any  Crowd control  they just kept arriving and being allowed entry   surely there is, or should be, a maximum limit! The most famous structure, well, Disney one that it, is the Castle. Once you could walk thru, into or around but not on my day. The lower 40% or so was covered up. A pic of the upper portion was still quite good and would give the littlies a thrill. Refreshments etc quite fairly priced."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"602570893,4,2018-7,United States,""I   m not one for Disney theme parks, and the price seems a bit high in my opinion, but if you   re in the area with kids, it   s perfectly respectable amusement park with a decent bit of rides, especially for the younger set.

But not too early as the night show at Disney land is even better than the shows during the day. The lion king performance is a 20 10!!!

We spent around 7 hours there just couldn't hang out until the light show but the parade during the day was fantastic so don't miss it we went on rides and watched both a 3 D film show and a stage show that were both great and gave us a bit of a break out of the heat seating down in the air conditioned theatres on top of that there there are plenty of drink and food outlets scattered around the park together with your Disney souvenirs and they are not that expensive compared to what your use to paying in Australia."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The cost is expensive for what's here priced at $124 new zealand. Due to the heat it would be better to visit from 2pm until closing as this would give you time to enjoy the park and see the parades. Do take your own food and drink as food here is expensive. The waiting time for most rides can be up to an hour but you might get lucky. Get a fast past to avoid the lines.

"599421720,5,2018-7,Philippines,""It's so nice HK has specific station that would take you to Disneyland. So hassle free and easy. We arrived there at 11AM. Tip: buy tickets in advance at klook or kkday as it will save your time queueing. Be there weekdays as tourists flock during weekends. We were so happy the weather was so good! Initially we checked the weather one week before and it states that thunderstorms will occur but it turned out sunny! We were able to enjoy almost all the rides, almost but not all. There are still some live shows but I am not really a fan of it. For me, one day is enough as HK's disney is smaller compared to HK Shanghai and Paris, accordingly. If you're visiting during summer, bring gear up comfortable outfits as it is really hot, and wear rubber shoes as it really involves a lot of walking. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"599256920,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,""When we visited the castle was under construction but it certainly didn't take away the Disney magic. It was an amazing sight seeing the park contrasted against the green mountains. There are loads of rides and shows to fill 1 2 days. However there aren't very many shops in main street USA. Still enough to get your Disney goods.Toy story land was roughly the same size as Paris. Their 'big thunder mountain' ride was a high lite. One of the best rides I have ever been on in Disney park. We all came off in fits of laughter and were so unprepared for all the twists and surprises.We could see there were more marvel rides being built so the park is expanding.There aren't as many restaurants as the other parks however there is a fair amount of variety. The food isnt massively catered towards western culture however you can still get burgers, fried chicken ect.Being a huge Disney fan I absolutely loved the park and would love to go back once the new castle has been built."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"598809669,5,2018-7,Canada,""A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Others were mostly routine stuff.Easy to navigate (though a bit hot   in June)Staff were very friendly , everything was well organised. The place is well maintained. Lot of greenery.As expected, food is costly (outside food is not allowed, bags are checked at the entrance).Wifi (free) is not very good, didn't find their app very useful.The night parade was fantastic and worth the wait.We took a two day pass (is only marginally more expensive than one day ticket)Better to go early (and of course avoid holidays and weekends). Still you might find some school trips which will add to the waiting time.Can be easily accessed by MTR, but we preferred to stay in the nearby Disney hotel (regular free shuttle buses are available)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"598687435,5,2018-4,Thailand,""Got a two day pass this time so my daughter would have a grand time in the park. I expected that the queues would be very long to every ride and every photo op with the characters. It was indeed. We enjoyed the parades the most. Anyway, on the second day, when i hit the star wars shop, I lost my wallet. I was so pissed when i was told that there was no CCTV in the shop. I couldn't just believe it. But since I don't want our days ruined, I asked help from the outside and still continued the journey until we got rescued by a friend of friend who lent us money for train fare and food. At 4PM though, I got an email from Disney that said that it could be my wallet that has been recovered so I ran to the lost and found area, left my daughter who was on queue to Cinderella Op to two nice local girls and voila, recovered my wallet which was intact by the way. With the many beautiful things that happened in between, someone unknown lent us money, two girls promised to take photos of my daughter with Cinderella in case I don't come back right away, a lady gave me discount coupons for items I want to buy and so on...I paid back good deeds by paying their items and food. The wallet that was returned was so unexpected! For me, that was magical.So there, Disneyland Hongkong is among the happiest place on Earth and is magical. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

When you factor in the lines, I don   t think anyone can go through the whole park in one day. We saw maybe a third of it. We were at Disneyland for about 6 hours.The food here is highly overpriced. The shops were crowded, but nice for AC. The bathrooms were a bit dirty. The toilets are on the ground (which is good for boys).There were a lot of rude tourists (adults and kids) who appear to be in a rush and were pushing a lot.Overall, it was worth visiting once. I may or may not go back when my son is older, more patient, and can protect himself from the tourists who push. FYI: I asked them at the gate....

Entry seems to be a very muddled affair with none of the gates moving fast, however when you are in everything works well.They open the different lands at different times which seems very strange. The Mystic Manor is definitely well worth going into.The park has the magic of the Disney parks and is well worth going to. I really am at a loss why you would need 2 days there, but I guess if you have small children it takes a longer to get from place to place.Plenty of different food options to choose from with a good mix of Asian and Western to choose from (prices are Hong Kong Prices so expensive).The parades get very crowded so well worth picking a good spot in the shade before it starts."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"596871568,4,2018-7,United States,""Pretty small and manageable  you can easily hit all the highlights within the first three or four hours of the park opening (assuming you go at line drop and don't stop for breakfast character meets etc). The park has a lot of repackaged rides areas from Disneyworld and Anaheim Disneyland, which was fine but nothing new. The best rides that are relatively novel to Hong Kong are Iron Man and Mystic Manor (the best, obviously). My favorite part of the whole park was actually the shows, which were really well done and blended Cantonese and English in a very accessible and interesting way. Definitely try to catch the Jedi Training  it was hilarious and great. The shows were the most identifiably  Hong Kong  part of the park, so they were really memorable for me, as a westerner. If you need an afternoon beer, River View Cafe has one beer on tap."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hong Kong Disneyland has some really unique attractions. Mystic Manor needs to be seen to be believed. This is a lot of fun and no other Disney work has something like this.

The park is much smaller than its USA counterparts but it is still a great Disney experience. There were little to no lines, many of the rides were the same so I got to ride rides that I wouldn   t wait in line for in the USA. And there were many rides the US parks didn   t have. The characters were all awesome and interacted with everyone in our party. I would definitely say Hong Kong Disney is a must do attraction while in Hong Kong!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We had pre booked and arrived on the Disney Train and exchanged our voucher for the tickets. The walk to the attractions was quite long but the kids really enjoyed themselves on the various rides and of course with popcorn and ice creams.Queues were really long so we tried to stay indoors and visited places like  It's a small world , although that had a very long queue and involved a lot of waiting before we could get a ride.This is the second Disneyland we have visited but due to the immense crowds and the hot weather the kids did not enjoy it as much as Tokyo Disneyland.

Food was expensive and quite good quality. The only issue I have is I wanted to get photo's with characters but didn't see one, which was disappointing, and we read the park brochure but there was very little information about where they were positioned during the day. I think you need more than one day, as we only had a short amount of time."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We went on almost all of the rides and saw all but one show and had dinner, watched the projection show and then the parade and it made for a full day. It was very enjoyable but very hot. Make sure you bring cash for purchases at small stands and remember there are ATM's if you need them. There isn't a lot of shade and in ToyStory land, not much shade. And it was hot!

It is definatley far less expensive than the other parks and less crowded. The staff seem to genuinely love their jobs as they all seem very happy. definately try and go mid week although we went Monday and Tuesday and whilst Monday was great with nearly no line ups. Tuesday was almost double the crowd size! Only  small  negative we thought was the limited food options.

I love that children below 2 yrs old are free. Lines for kiddie rides are on the average,    only    40 minutes. Not bad if you are carrying a toddler as you need to park your stroller before entering the cueing area. Food prices are as expected, on the high side. If you want to skip long lines, opt for the sit down restaurants like Maxim   s. Great Chinese food. Actually, I have not tried the other dining outlets. During our previous visit years ago, we also chose to eat at Maxim   s. At least, it is consistently good. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"595276758,2,2018-7,Barbados,""Although I read the reviews prior to going, I still wasn't expecting the park to be that small. The first disappointment was the 'fake' train station building.

Main Street was less than 5th of the length than it's counterparts, and castle (although surrounding by hoarding), looked no higher than your tallest basketball player! Many of the food establishments were closed, although what i eat eat was very good.

I am SO glad we did. We arrived in the afternoon on a Friday and decided to get in a half day at the park. We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of a crowd. We immediately noticed the friendliness of the staff and the smiles which were not common in Shanghai. The staff gave stickers and really tried to help us in English when needed. The crowds were well behaved and I was not pushed once all day!!!! Even the parades and the projection show were fun, orderly and well managed by the staff. Shanghai Disneyland could learn a lot from Hong Kong. The park is small and the castle was closed which made it feel smaller but it was so clean and happy that we really enjoyed ourselves. The Royal Banquet Hall in FantasyLand made us vegetarian spaghetti with marinara sauce that was really good. We also went to the park on Saturday and it was still pleasant with an increased crowd."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The park was very clean and we were impressed by the food options offered, much better than the usual fayre (burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets etc). Mystic Manor was the highlight for us, a real gem. Space mountain is slow and disappointing compared to Paris, could do with updating. Mine train was a good surprise.

We went in June so it was hot and humid. Pack water bottles, there are water filling stations everywhere. Go early and be there at opening as it gets really busy around midday. By mid afternoon the park was pumping with people. We went on a weekday so crowds were manageable. My tip would be to do Ironman and that section then hop over to Toyland if that   s on your list as it gets very very hot and crowded over there in the afternoon and there is limited shade. Wait times there were the longest at 30mins and in the heat we decided to bypass it. Food wasn   t as expensive as I expected. It   s not cheap though either, so have a good breakfast and if you choose something like a rice and curry for lunch it will fill you and keep you going until closing. Small snacks could have been taken in, but I think anything big would be confiscated. Don   t miss the Lion King show. I did and family who had seen the stage show and we   re unsure about going to it, said it was fantastic. I now regret not making the time to see it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We went on a Friday and there was a crowd but we still managed to cover much of the park. I have been to Magic Kingdom Disney in Orlando and it took us 2 days. We felt satisfied with the HK Disney after one day because we had covered so much due to the lack of lines. The Lion King show was a highlight.

Still, they did a great job with the Disney here. We thoroughly enjoyed it. While it wasn't close to Disney World, it was close to being there. They did a nice job with Tomorrowland. The show we saw was incredibly inclusive. It performed the songs in English. The dialogue was in Cantonese with subtitles on either side in English and Mandarin. Prices were Disney prices. Everything was pretty expensive, but that is the way Disney is. The parade at the end of the night was a lot of fun. Exiting the park was incredibly easy with the MTR stop right there.

"591857578,3,2017-7,India,""The trip to HK Disneyland was a blend of good and bad experiences. Firstly it's a bit expensive travel to and fro in MTR form Hong Kong or Central station to Disneyland. The entry ticket pass is also expensive. The only recommendation I would give is if you have been to any other disneyland's in the world or especially paris, skip this one for sure. There's no need to waste your time, money and a whole day for this place. I have been to another 3 disney's including paris and I am telling you from my experience. It is seriously not worth it. If you have kids who are under 15 then you can surely opt a day out in disney but if you are traveling adults or teens like me in early 20's then it's a strict no. They don't have any thrilling rides for adults or teens. Though the whole idea behind creating a disney park is for children but they should keep in mind that children are not the only age group that visit. Besides it is so packed and flocked. The queues and waiting times are very long and lengthy. There's not much seating space with shade. The food and drinks in the disney are way too expensive. Not much choices for vegetarians. The Ocean Park is a very good alternative for Disneyland. You can choose Ocean Park over Disneyland on any given day and you surely won't regret it. Kids will surely love disneyland but not all age groups I am afraid. The evening lights in the park are very pretty. Hence we made a mistake and sacrificed a day which we could had utilized for a better purpose."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"591653661,5,2018-6,United States,""With this Disney I now had all 6 under my belt. This one is said to be the least favorite but I thoroughly enjoyed my whole day. Yes, it is small and the castle was an eyesore being renovated. No one seems to understand the fast passes so I was able to use them all day.

"591344928,5,2018-6,Australia,""After having been to Disneyland Paris and Japan I thought why not Hong Kong. Unfortunately we had a lot of rain the day of our visit so some rides were closed until mid afternoon. Good range of attractions and rides for all ages with a good selection of different restaurants. The park has an app that makes getting around a breeze, the app also gave wait times for major rides and attractions. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"591199364,3,2018-6,Hong Kong,""I hate to give Disney a bad review but I have not been to Hong Kong Disneyland in about four years and I was a bit disappointed today. It was just not quite    on pointe    and lacked some of that    Disney Magic   . Small things were out of place... for example some of the lights not working and the rain chains not lying correctly in the rain forest scene in    it   s a small world   , a maintenance man fixing a gate that was not even being used (with all his tools on the ground in front of him) in the line of    Ironman Experience    while visitors were walking by to ride and the majority of the non performing cast members looking like they hated their jobs   no smiles.We were looking forward to seeing the new Moana show but the venue is absolutely ridiculous. Only three rows of seats in an area that could accommodate a lot more and not much shade cover so unless you got the seats, you had to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes to watch. That made the entire show very unenjoyable and was a real downer. The kids hated it and said it was the worst part of their day. It   s seriously just seemed like Disney took the cheap route to create a new entertainment item.Also, we did not see it posted anywhere, not even on the Disneyland app, that they now close the rides in the back of the park one hour before closing time    We wasted time walking to the back of the park to ride some of those rides again and we would have changed our evening schedule had we known they would close early. We used to love riding the Mine Cars in the dark before the park closed.My sister was visiting us and is an avid Disney fan. She said,    No wonder no one comes to this Disneyland. The park is not open enough hours to get your money   s worth, they close some of the rides early and there is not a lot of shade cover compared to the other hot location, Walt Disney World in Florida.   I expect more from Disney. Thankfully, the new Light Parade is fantastic and so the day ended with that classic    Disney Magic   . "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"591172739,4,2018-6,India,""it can be exhausting to spend whole day here. Rides have long queues but shows like lion king is nice. Adventure zone Tomorrowland highly recommended to start with first. Jungle river cruise in adventure land is nice too. Most rides end by 6 pm...while parade happens at 8.45...a long wait. Parade earlier used to be proper walk of Mickey, Donald but now they mainly use LED floats which are not that interesting. We faced thunderstorm on our visit so many rides got cancelled & we got wet. Food is not widely available & is restricted.

"591146220,5,2017-11,United States,""Disneyland never disappoints and is a wonderfully magical place. I have never been to any other Disneyland and I visited the Hong Kong Disneyland with a couple of friends who go to the parks in the states yearly. Hong Kong disneyland is smaller in comparison to the other Disneyland but it is just as magical, with shows happening all around the park all day long and characters walking the streets. We had a suprise while attending shows when us Americans (being only english speakers) were greeted with bilingual shows! We found this quite entertaining. We went to this park in November so everything was decorated in a Christmas theme and they even had a Christmas parade and a wonderful (fake) Snowfall!!! My friends had been missing our snowy winter weather at home so this was a fantastic surprise when loads of snow was shot over the crowd with flashing Christmas lights and festive music.Would definitely recommend visiting the Hong Kong Disneyland to people of all ages as it is truly the happiest place on earth!

Though, the adventure can be tiring, so make sure that you are well rested before coming. Wear comfortable shoes as well. Come early so you can make the most out of the rides.

"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"590103964,4,2018-6,United Kingdom,""The smallest of all the Disneys we   ve been to, but the flip side of this was that it was much quieter (we queued for a maximum of 15 minutes, most of the time able to get on rides in quick succession) and also quicker to get around (it   s not a trek from one side of the park to the other).Food and drink is reasonably priced overall. However, water at   3 a bottle was fairly steep.There was some renovation taking place at the laughably small castle which hampered some of the space in the park.Staff were all friendly and courteous throughout. An area for improvement would be the types of badge they give you in entry needing variety (other Disney parks have    just married   ,    Birthday    etc).Having been to an animation academy before at a different Disney, we were pleased that this was available here too. While the classes say they are only in Cantonese, don   t be put off as it   s easy to follow, great fun, and they do throw in a few English explanations along the way.Very easy to get there via HK metro   there   s a special Disney line which takes you the last part of the way.

This was our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland and we opted not to stay onsite, but the park is so calm, that we really did not need to.From our hotel in Mongkok, the MTR ride to the park was only about 30 minutes. We lined up for entrance and it moved pretty fast. We never needed to use a fastpass and we were able to ride everything we wanted to. The cast members were also very helpful and we just had a great time. This is the only park in the world that is not as busy as other Disney parks, but I think that will change soon with the new castle and the new additions.

"589615868,4,2018-6,Malaysia,""Took our 2 year old boy to Hkg Disneyland for his birthday. Choosed Hkg as this was the nearest in terms of flight time from KL, was worried he wouldnt take to kindly to being strapped down to his seat, going was stressful but coming home was easier as he slept throughout his flight. One thing i discovered was in order to take loads of pix with Mickey and gang, best place is to dine in one of theyre restaurants where makes they make scheduled appearances, taking photos with Disney characters in Disneyland itself entails a long queue. Staying in Disney hotels was also a treat. Travelling to and from Disneyland and even to the city was easy as they had frequent free coaches. Going a week before the holidays, and on a weekday, queues for the rides were fast and short. Be prepared to spend though as the Disney Resort Hotel, all day tickets, foods and gift shop items are not cheap. All in all it was an enjoyable experience and my kid had a blast hugging and kissing Mickey and gang, not to mention mummy and daddy had a jolly good time to. For parents worrying abt strollers, they hv the Disney strollers.

"589248429,4,2018-6,India,""Check the weather before you go, if it   s raining, you won   t see many characters outside. The outdoor ride close, just indoor options available. A really pleasant surprise was on the 2nd day, the staff at the MTR told me the park may be closed due to the rains, while I bought the tickets. If you still decide to go, we did on both rainy days as we had a 2 day pass, take a rain coat  umbrella. Or pay HK $70 to buy one at the park.Lot of walking to do, plan your visit and what you want to do before you get there. This way you will finish off all that you want, before exhausting yourself and most importantly if you have kids. It can get really hot and humid!My little girl is a princess maniac and the experience of meeting Snow White, Elsa, Sophia, Tinker Bell, Moana was quite phenomenal. I loved the way the characters interact with kids making it a truly memorable experience. If you are looking for A particular character, make sure you check if they are on schedule the day you   re going. E.g. Elsa, we went on Tue and Fri and we could meet Elsa only on Fri. They have fixed timings, so planning will certainly help.The shows are good too, Lion King, Moana, etc. Plan 30 mins per show, minimum. The night parade is awesome, I see kids fascinated by the light show and characters.Food is good, lot of options available. If you have the 2 day pass, make sure you have the eTicket handy the 2nd day, even if you   ve registered with you finger print.Pretty easy to get there via MTR.We   ve been to the one in Paris, this one though smaller definitely packs a punch.

"589220822,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,""I had purchased my park tickets from a travel agent a few days prior, this meant less queuing at the park, it was also cheaper than buying direct, I got this in Tai Po but am sure most travel agents will be able to help.Arrived early Via a 2 buses from Sha Tin, the transport links are brilliant and well signed, We arrived before the park opened so near the front of the que and saw Mickey and Minnie greeting people before the gates officially opened. The park its self is smaller than the others I had visited (Paris and Orlando) but still plenty to do. Lion King Show was a highlight and we saw this twice. With the help of some good fortune Fast passes and single rider queues we managed to get on 11 rides see 2 shows one twice and meet 3 characters so if you plan your day well it   s easy to see a lot of the park in one day, which is not really possible is any of the others. The Space mountain now a Star Wars ride was really well themed, the Avengers part of the park was also very well done with the iron man ride a nice little attraction, but very similar to the Star Wars rides in other parks. The Mickey Mouse celebration projector show was first class and well worth the wait. Couple of Negatives for me, the Castle was closed which we knew about but obviously takes away the famous photo opportunity, also the iPhone app and the Website showed different times for the park closing which also meant it showed the wrong time for the parade, this left me sat on main street an hour longer than I had hopped.But overall a very enjoyable park with some very fun rides, it is most certainly is the happiest place on earth."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"589094833,4,2018-6,United States,""So, it   s not to the caliber of the original but it is a nice park. Smaller than Anaheim Disney but with a smaller and quite reasonable price tag. Second day ticket is a fraction of the cost of day one. Lines were 20 30 minutes on a Saturday unheard of at other Disney locations.Like the other Disney parks the castle and several other areas are being brought into the 21st century so expect some closures. If your a Disney fan make the stop.

There are fast rides as well as moderate rides. For those who do not want to sit on rides can enjoy the shows. Do not miss out on the Lion King Show, Mystic Manor Show, Mickey's Wondrous Book & Phillar's 3 D show. Also a must do is the Night Parade."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are also some upgrades and renovations on some of the rides compared to the last round I came which is ten over years ago. Food prices are more reasonable with varieties though taste not very fantastic. Queues are quite long probably due to their public holidays and school holidays and quite a lot of their locals are in the park too. Just a note that there are no more fireworks and parade of the characters. Only lightning visuals displays. Toilets there are cleaner than before and it   s air conditioned. Most of the rides are indoors which is good as the summer period can be very hot like in Singapore. Cons:Not many complaints except for the long queuing time.

"588779840,4,2018-5,Singapore,""It   s my 2nd time there in 3 years. This time round we found that some of the ride didn   t seem as good as before as they may have made some alterations. Example that it   s a small world ride used to keep repeating the song the last time but this time it   s just played once combined with the music. The other Pooh ride used to have a lot of pretty panels each time you turn into an area but now it seems the amount of panels has lessen and the ride shorten. Even the night parade cars are less gorgeous as the 1st time we saw it. But then we also discovered other rides we haven   t been able to ride on the first time we went. The new iron man experience was quite awesome! There   s also an iron man virtual reality game for my 2 yr old son at the store in the Tomorrowland which is quite fun while his parents went solo and used the fast passes for the main attractions. As for the other ride we tried as single rider while our son slept, it   s the toy soldier parachute drop. It   s not for young kids.. but teens shld be able to withstand the excitement and not break into tears. Also we think the mickey   s philharmagic at fantasyland is pretty awesome but then my son was a bit scare of it maybe due to the loud noise inside.. so really have to consider if bringing very young kids there. The only one ride that my son loves is the slinky dog spin at toy story land. As for the other ride that his parents enjoyed, it   s the mystic manor. As usual it   s not for very young kids as it   s quite dark in there and can be scary for them. My son is pretty cool with the dumbo ride and obitron which is pretty much the same type of ride. As for food, we think the best food court is at fantasyland and also mystic point. It   s good to go during weekdays as it   s less crowded and if there in summer, do 1 2 of the outdoor rides u wish to try before going indoors for the rest till later in the afternoon. This works really well for us as we try the dumbo and obitron ride first before going indoors for other rides like Pooh ride, mickey   s philarmagic, it   s a small world, Ironman and hyperspace mountain, till later in the day when it   s not so hot did we go to toy story area for the other rides there. Utilize the fast passes and single rider options when you   re there to save some time in the park."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Don   t get me wrong there are queues and everywhere packed but probably because of the design everybody   s dispersed more or less evenly. The food and drinks are expensive but you would expect it given such location so no point complaining. The souvenir shops are well stocked with variety and plenty of shops to temp you and kids. Takes a very strong will to not spend on any item in there. All in a great place to visit, if you have kids just bring them you are guaranteed a good time here. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"587107992,5,2018-5,Australia,""My daughter and I had a magical two days here celebrating her 13th birthday, travelling all the way from Sydney, Australia!Right from the time we entered the park on 30th May things were lovely. We loved the photographer who took our photos at the gate and later again on Main St. Her name was Harley and she made our buying the photo pass well worth it! The photo lady at the Winnie the Pooh ride was also really helpful, explaining how the photo pass worked and getting all of our photos downloaded onto the app on my phone. (She also helped me download the app and helped me sign up.) It felt so great to see the professional photos from that day and even breakfast all there, safe on my phone! I wish I could mention her name too!Although we were just able to do all of the rides in one day (we went mid week out of school holidays) we also needed a day to line up and have photos with characters. My daughter loved meeting Piglet, Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Cinderella, Aurora, Chip and Dale and Minnie and Mickey. Just be aware that the lines always seem to be really long for Minnie and Mickey and you have to be early and quick for the princesses (except Princess Sophia as she doesn't seem very popular at all).We had 12 fast passes for two each from our hotel (Disney Explorers Lodge) but we only ended up using 5 of them because there was not more than 5 minutes wait time for any ride apart from Winnie the Pooh and the Parachute Drop. We did use them for the Winnie ride because my daughter really loved it. We really loved being near the It's a small world ride early in the day when no one was around. I love that It's a small world and Winnie the Pooh are air conditioned. We also especially loved the Mystic Manor ride (also air conditioned).We took our own water bottles in and loved our meal at the Plaza Inn for my daughter's birthday. (We booked in advance but it was not busy.) The pork fillet was delicious. The other evening we ate fish bites and chips in the cafeteria at Tomorrowland which was pretty standard American food but at least it was air conditioned and quick. We also had the incredibly cute donuts which my daughter loved eating.We knew the castle was being renovated in advance but the Main Street photographers still managed to get nice photos of us with it. Main St was pretty much deserted about 3pm the Wednesday we were there so we got some great photos! Again, thanks to the lovely photographer, Harley!Well worth visiting, especially if you are from Australia as it is not as far as the USA. Thanks, Hong Kong Disneyland, for a magical visit!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Disneyland is constantly adding and renewing their attraction. However one main reasons to postpone your visit here (at least until late 2019) because the main castle is under renovation. The renovation also means that there are no fireworks show, which makes come to Disneyland is less worth these days. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"586921995,5,2018-4,United Arab Emirates,""Mention Disney, and most immediately think crazy crowds along with Disney Magic. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of my favorite parks because it strikes the perfect balance retaining the magic and charm that we have come to expect from a Disney Park while also having lower than normal (for Disney) crowds! Be sure to avoid weekends and holidays (I only went during non Holiday weekdays) when I hear that crowds can be much thicker, and you will enjoy shorter wait times, the ability to randomly catch a parade or show, and the opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace. This Disney fanatic recommends two days to be able to experience EVERYTHING in the park (all the rides, shows, parades and a couple of repeat rides on your favorites) but I realize that I am the exception and that most could do the park well enough in a single day. The unique to Hong Kong Disney rides are definitely worth going out of your way to experience if you are in the area and a fan of Disney at all. For our family, it was simply magical!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"586860481,4,2018-6,United Kingdom,""Visited with family on a quiet day luckilyJust wish they would cater more for the disabled. I am registered blind and do not use any rides, however you can only have a disabled ticket and price of 100 hk dollars if you are a resident otherwise it's full priceSo it makes it very expensive day for me just to get pushed round. Luckily it wasn't too busy as this Disney doesn't do the fast pass entry for those with disabled guests either like Shanghai one does. I had to queue in the line with my daughter and son in law or they had to leave me in the wheelchair before entering line, which can be is uncomfortable when you have very little vision Most staff seem friendly, Overall good but could do better for people with disabilities "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"586780267,4,2018-6,United States,""My family really enjoyed this park. They have some great rides only found at this park. A comment that gets mentioned a lot is that this is smaller than some of the other parks, and that is true, but it is also less congested than most of the other parks by a good margin, meaning you'll ride more rides and spend less time waiting.

Even with the lines (mostly 15 20min wait) we saw almost everything. We missed a few thing because the timing plus we had a child with us, so that don   t help with timing. Over all we had a great time and what I think the best part is that since the park is smaller in size there was less walking to go from place to place. (lol)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Smaller in size compared to other Disneylands, it makes it very bearable to walk through the park. Since it is smaller, it has fewer attractions but the essential ones are there. One piece of advice, do price comparisons of the souvenirs and try as much not to buy it in the stores at Main Streey."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The not to miss is all the rides and specially the little world show of dolls. Fun unlimited for kids as they get to click pictures with all the characters of disney here and there...You will need 2days atleast to cover with kids... you start and end with the U.S street there are some places to eat Its best to download their app and be on time for all shows... know how long the lines are in which ride or show... definitely an enjoyable experience ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It   s a personal preference.3.finish all the rides on your list before taking pictures. Picture taking will consume most of your time and before you   ll know it, people are already flocking.4.it opens 10AM 8:30PM no fireworks after or you may ask some staffs if they do have that day.5. Its wifi almost everywhere. Bring extra batteries for your phone or cameras. Selfie sticks are not allowed.6. Have a heavy breakfast! Foods are expensive! Or take your lunch early or late.

"585983137,5,2018-5,Malaysia,""The most exciting part of our HK trip. To start off, we travelled to Disneyland in MTR to experience the mickey themed train! It was fab.. We loved it.. Even the MTR Disneyland station was so cool! Do not miss this.. If you have enough time.. Take the train! We stayed in Disney's Hollywood Hotel.. It was convenient.. no need to worry about transport.. Plenty of shuttle buses available from the park to the hotels. Coming to the theme park, alot of people suggested that one day is enough to cover the park, but i personally feel that if you want to get a full Disney experience then go for 2 days. That's exactly what we did and we still didn't feel it was enough..(maybe we were just too excited !)The park is big (although i read it was the smallest of disney theme parks). Be sure to get a map and the show schedule when you enter.. Take note of the shows you want to watch and manage your time accordingly. Expect long queues after afternoon at every ride (waiting time around 30 40mins). Tips : (1) Start off with the 'land' that is furthest away first to avoid queues. Some lands open after 11am..The best for us was Toy Story Land.(2) Meals are quite reasonably priced in the park as compared to in the hotels.. So we had lunch and dinner at the park (also because we waited till the final parade). Plenty of Vegetarian options available too. (3) If you have two days, watch all the shows, stage plays and parades on day 1 and do the rides on day 2. That's what we did..so we had ample time for pictures and exploring.(4) If you want to meet and greet characters, be in queue atleast 15mins before else be prepared to wait atleast 60mins in queue. (5) The castle is closed for maintenance works till later this year. There is no fireworks as well. Overall , we had so so much fun in Disney.. Loved it , recommend it !"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

But obviously that was no fault to Disney, it was just bad luck. However thankfully they opened up later in the day so we really enjoyed them. We only ate in one restaurant and the food was really nice and the service was quick and friendly. The shops on main street were also really good. Full of great Disney merch at decent prices. The staff there are also very helpful. Despite there being bigger rides here they definitely aren   t    thrill    rides, but they are still enjoyable, just more on the tame side. Unfortunately they are renovating the castle so we couldn   t get a decent picture infront of it but never mind. The park is also very small compared to other Disneyland   s but we only had a day ticket and we managed to do everything so that was fantastic and worth the money.

"585488713,4,2018-6,India,""Visited on a Sunday, unfortunately, and it was one of those hot, bright days (3rd June) which meant we couldnt cover too much. Wasted too much time and exhausted ourselves at the start itself waiting for the customary Mickey Minnie photo. Skip it if the line is too long and esp if you are staying at one of the Disney hotels where you can anyway meet them at breakfast. Plan the itinerary well because its no fun going from one land to another in confusion. Its much too hot, food is overpriced, and they don't accept anything but cash for most small purchases like icecream. Although they say outside food and drink not allowed, no one really objected to ours although they checked our bags. Some of the rides like Dumbo and It's a small world are really worth waiting for, but the lines for the Winnie the pooh boat ride were so long and the ride just quite repetitive. I guess you have to prioritize based on your interests. Can't cover it all! By the time we made it to the Lion King show, we were near collapse, I was afraid my son had caught a heat stroke, and we beat a hasty retreat. Happiest place on earth? No way, not in this weather. Not at all. Be careful when you visit in May June with small kids."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dont miss the parades in the afternoon as well as night parade as both are different. Unfortunately during our visit the castle was closed and there were no fireworks.

"585449357,5,2018-1,India,""You need to be smart to enjoy the HK Disneyland. Tips: Its easy to reach by the metro line as there is special metro line for Disneyland. Try to reach before the rope drop. Dont carry selfie stick as its not allowed. Pick the park map. After the rope drop just rush to the attractions of your choice and take the fast pass. Fast pass machines are installed on the important attractions and you can find it in the park map. You can avoid long queues if you pick the fast pass in advance and it gives you the time by when you need to come back for that specific ride attraction. This was you can save time and avoid queues. Please note that you can pick only one fast pass at a time. So plan your day smartly. Do try out the Hyperspace mountain extreme roller coaster and the Mine Cars.

Though most of the park is designed to look like the original Disney World, the Iron Man ride had a Hong Kong theme. Lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant (in Mystic Point) was pricey but good.

"583789057,5,2017-6,India,""When we headed for Disneyland i was personally though this place is for children, me and my freinds thought we will sit at one place at let kids enjoy the place.To my utter surprise it turned out to be different. Totally totally different. I enjoyed more than my kids. The child within me was reborn.One of the best places on the earth that i have visited so far. We were there for two full days and walked around 20kms or more to cover and see each and every show and place in disneyland and no body in the group felt tired. The place lives upto its tagline   the happiest place on earth. We were so excited after first day of visit that the second day it was announced that it is a storm of 9 danger. We (including kids) were so disappointed that we did not came out of our rooms. But as it is said   when you seek from GOD with all your heart, he obliges  and magic happened. The storm warning came off at around 11am and then there was no looking back.A must must place to visit with kids once in a life time. I BET YOU WILL ENJOY."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"583784833,5,2018-5,Australia,""My wife and I came to Disneyland with expectations that we would be too old to enjoy it. Gladly we were overjoyed with the fun experience. It is a large park so expect to spend at least 6   9 hours there to enjoy all the park has to offer.Plenty of food, plenty of tourist shops and souvenirs to buy from. The rides were free, that was a surprise because we thought they may have charged for attractions but they were free to enter. The attractions, rides, tours, interactive experiences were very enjoyable and worth spending your time to seek out. Tons of things to do, you and take your time and sit around and take in the carnival atmosphere.The park was undergoing some renovations so we didn't see everything but what we did experience was a lot of good fun.Easy to book your ticket from a hotel from a Handy handset in the hotels or on your mobile phone. The price was well worth the experience, go and have a look you won't be disappointed!!! Much more than I can describe! 11 10 from me!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
583664630,4,2018-5,India,When we were heading to this place some in our group said that this place is only for the children. We will come out in half a day and go out for some other place. But one day was insufficient for the Disney land you need at least one more day. All the events and attractions were too good. Of all the paradeby 8.30pm was classic. More than the children all of us enjoyed. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"583615974,2,2018-5,Singapore,""My wife and I are Disney fans. We aren   t particularly fanatical but we have enjoyed our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and are the type to go before opening and stay till closing time. Since we were coming to HK, we couldn   t pass up the opportunity to visit HK Disneyland as I had never been before.Based on reviews online, I had already tempered expectations but even then, I was disappointed when we got there. The good thing was that the queue to get into the park and the rides was so short (we went on a weekday). I enjoyed the trackless mystic manor ride. The effects and the ride experience is one of a kind and highly recommended. Grizzly mine cart was fun too with 2 unexpected twists, no spoilers here.That   s about all the good I can really say, now the parts that disappointed:I don   t see what   s the point of letting guests in 15 minutes early to the Main Street before they open up the park proper. After they finally opened the park, I didn   t expect other parts of the park ( toy story, etc) to open at 11. They also closed earlier at 730pm. The place was already so small, surely they could organise it such that all parts of the park could open and close simultaneously.As we walked around the park, many snack stands were still closed and many cafes were closed for the day. It takes away from the festivity of the place.We were the first to sit Mystic Manor and we were excited but when we got to the ride, we found the girls standing around chatting and they looked surprised to see us. They then hurriedly rushed off to prep and asked us to wait 5 minutes. It felt like they lacked a lot of professionalism. The staff were also not enthusiastic and acted like they were there because it was their job and not because they had a love of Disney. They could fake it even if they didn   t but they didn   t bother and most looked very blas  .It did not feel magical at all. The food was also very mediocre. The crowd in general was a lot ruder than the crowd at Tokyo Disneyland. I had multiple groups of people cut in front of me while it was obvious I was waiting to take a picture of my wife and they saw me. People yelling across the street for each other. Some people tried to pick the best seats for the rides so service staff had to tell them to move down the line and they looked displeased they were told to do so.The stuff in the shops felt a little    recycled   . We saw goods from Paris Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland there. Felt almost like they were given the leftovers from other Disneyland resorts. Albert the monkey at Mystic Manor is a character unique to HK Disneyland but they were sold out for some of his goods and the sales lady said they weren   t sure if they were going to continue making it again. We went at 10, left by 430pm and don   t ever plan on going back. I expected much more and had hoped for a decent experience but I feel like HK Disneyland didn   t put in enough effort to make the place as magical as it should be, especially moreso for the ticket price they are charging. It felt like this resort is just riding off the popularity of the Disney name but it did not do it justice. If you really want to go, look for discount tickets, don   t pay full price. Go with kids since the queue is so short, they can ride the rides repeatedly and you don   t have to rush there in the morning. Also, unlike Tokyo Disneyland, there   s a proper line to do the character meet and greets so you will assured of a picture as long as you brave the long queues. It gets very hot during the summer so be sure to lather on sunscreen and bring a hat umbrella. There is barely any shade there. Use the lockers to stash your stuff, you can reopen them anytime so it is worth the money to get one. Nothing is cheap in Disneyland, the only magic I felt was how quickly your money goes while you are there.I really had hoped for more from Hong Kong Disneyland but I think I won   t ever return unless they do a major revamp, for both the park itself and its staff."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"583584033,5,2018-5,Malaysia,""Love hong kong disneyland!, try avoid month of may july as the heat is crazy! Crowd was alright during weekdays, each rides took about 5 10 minutes queue. Make sure to bring empty bottles for water refills near any toilets unless you would like to pay the ripped off price mineral bottle water. Food was expensive but nice! The cinderella and the price was kinda disappointing. Avoid renting baby strollers during summer, unless you want to bake and sun burn your baby. The main castle was closed for renovation...very disappointing again. Poor dancers sweating so much in their custume parade. Generally will visit again! Mystic manor is a must to visit!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"583568083,5,2018-5,Singapore,""Little did I know that after having a wonderful, fun filled, memorable experience at HK Disneyland with my family including the newly discovered Advance Pass for its attractions, where you don't need to fall in line and just have to go back on your designated time. It was truly amazing that means we can save time at no extra cost and maximize most of the tours in Disney.Now going back to my review is one of the restaurants inside Disneyland located on the Main Street USA zone near the entrance   Plaza Inn Restaurant. Just after the Flights of Fantasy Parade we stumbled by accident this place as we are about to exit. And with utter coincidence we are looking for a good authentic HK Chinese food in particular Roast Goose. Inspired by Mulan anime   the interior is very authentic cultural Chinese with red lanterns and intricate furnish and carvings. The service is nice and hospitable. The ambience is relaxing, luxurious and comfortable. The toilets are clean and spacious. The airconditioning is perfectly cool. We are a family of 8 with 3 kids and of course very hungry after a long day of walk at Disneyland HK. We ordered 2 servings of Yang chow fried rice good for 4 people, Roast goose, Beef broccoli, Roasted pork belly, and a Chinese oolong tea for hot drink. They don't serve free water but the drinks were affordable. True enough the one that stood out amongst the dishes we ordered is the Roast goose   savoury, succulent, juicy, tender and fresh. Despite the flavours and spices added you could still taste the freshness of the Roast goose   and most of all it melts in your mouth. HK has many famous restaurants that serve Roast goose. The flavour stands out for any combinations and it is very delicious                     The price is very similar to a typical restaurant inside the park which a bit pricey than outside but then again it is worth it. Next time you visit HK Disneyland don't forget to drop by Plaza Inn."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"583505064,5,2018-5,Hong Kong,""When my boys were young, my wife and I took our children to Disney in Florida, Los Angeles, Paris, and Japan before Hong Kong Disney was open in 2005. Comparing with Hong Kong Disneyland with other Disneyland in other parts of the world. Hong Kong Disneyland began as a tiny one. But over the last 13 years, Disneyland added new games into this tiny one. By now, I would say, Disneyland in Hong Kong is not big but good enough for 1 to 2 days if you have 1 or 2 kids to play with. I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland about 4 to 5 times. I would say, they need to continuously expand to keep up with visitors' expectation."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was not too busy on a Sunday in May so the queues were not too long.

It was fun roller coster ride and worthy game. From Marvel hero, Buzz Lightyear ride, winnie the pooh, Tarzan and more disney related. Few places still under construction.

However, I am quite unaware about how time quickly skips by. The queues to the rides   almost all  took around 30 40 minutes. And we rarely chance on character greetings   only R2 D2 and Chewbacca at Star Wars. Mickey and Minnie and Baymax is always fully queued or unavailable. :( I think our whole day's worth of visit was not enough. But again, we had fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"582442916,4,2018-5,Hong Kong,""This is our first time to the Disneyland after 13 years since its opening. I like the size of the park for it's spacious but not too big. Every spot can be accessed easily without the need to walk too far. Thank you for all the cast members for being so professional (except for one or two) especially under the hot weather. However, I would like to suggest Disneyland to install misting system in the park before the hot summer comes. It's only May but it gets quite hot already and I can't imagine how it's like in Jun Sep. The hot weather may lower people's interests in visiting the park. I remember that when I went to theme parks in other countries, they have misting system which helps cool guests down. Maybe they should consider that too. Also, I think they should place more canopies along the pathways so that guests can take a rest from the sun during the summer. I truly hope that everyone will enjoy their visits to Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

All the favourite characters were there and some great rides for all ages. It's big enough to keep you entertained and small enough to see in 1 day. Expensive merchandise (as expected) but otherwise a really great day. Even with a lot of people the queues weren't too long. They are very good at entertaining you as you stand in line. It's very professional and runs smoothly. Lost my phone on the first ride and the helpful and friendly staff quickly found it for me. Our 7 year old said she had the best day of her life!

The tree house walk was also very attractive. The pooh and the lion king shows were nice too.. please remember that they give fast track time bound tickets free of cost at the attractions so that if you come at that particular time for that ride you do not have to wait in the long serpentine queues. But they do not mention it anywhere so be sure to ask their personnels standing outside the attractions. The train at the entrance of the park takes you through the park and you can get off at Fantasy land Area to explore the various attractions there. But there are huge lines for boarding this train so be prepared for waiting in long queues in this hot weather before you can board this train. Its a small world attraction is also very cute especially for young kids. There are some thrilling roller coaster rides too. The food banquet hall in the Fantasyland area has some good indian food and also has some nice veggie options. The afternoon and late evening carnivals are real fun to watch for kids and adults.

During the day as towel dries out just wet it again under a cold water tap.I suggest downloading the Disneyland Hong Kong app (great for map, character times, queue wait times the Park has limited WiFi)With two parades, three shows, an evening Light Projection Show in Main St (instead of fireworks whilst Castle is under maintenance) , approx 17 rides things to see plus numerous Character opportunities, at the minimum I would suggest a 2Day ticket. If you are staying longer, look at a Magic Access 12month pass)  most of our party purchased a Silver Magic Access Pass (no weekend entry) and we went 3 4 different days. We didnt have to rush around and we got to do our fave rides more than once or twice.The Silver magic access pass also gave 10% disc on merchandise shopping and 10% off at character dining and sone general dining in the Park (or had meal deal free drink kind of offers).Fave rides? I would say Iron Man ";" Runaway Mine Cars and for my daredevil brother it was Hyperspace Mountain. But we really did love most of them. Glad we got to see Festival of the Lion King, as this is about to change to Moana show.We had 2 (cheap) strollers we left in the stroller parking area many times , no problems there with anyone stealing them!Because we went to the park on weekdays, we had no issues with long wait times (plus we tried to do the popular ones earlier in the morning eg Parachute drop) .We tried to ask the children which Characters they REALLY wanted to see eg their Top 5...otherwise it can be time consuming (not to mention exhausting in the hot sun) spending lots of time queuing up. I found it beneficial to check Character times before we left and noting down the times and location on a piece of paper, spread out throughout the day based on their 'must see'! We started queueing 5 10min before so we were in the line several times we arrived 10 15 mins from the start time and they had already closed the queue due to so many people. Mickey and Minnie seemed to have the longest lines.We dined at The Enchanted Restaurant at the Disneyland Hotel  it is approx 15 minute walk from admission gates of the Park. We absolutely loved it, we dined mid week 5:30 7:30pm and from around 6:00 7:15pm we had Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto. They come separately to every single table and the official photographers come too. Their helpers will also take pics with your phone and cameras. And the food! The variety was beyond belief and delicious. And dessert buffet, (see below pic) oh wow! Soooo good, highly recommend."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
581159934,2,2017-8,Australia,A good effort but doesn   t really get close to the real deal. We visited out of curiosity but were a bit disappointed. Not really that entertaining for couples or families alike if you have experienced the real USA version.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"581131471,4,2018-5,Singapore,""The experience would be excellence if not for the super hot weather. We forgot to bring along sunblock and we got sunburnt after our 2nd day in Disneyland. We went on a weekday and the queue wasn't too long. There wasn't a queue at the IronMan experience when we went over in the afternoon. There wasn't a need for Fast Pass at all. It was a pity the castle was under renovations when we visited, and there were not many theatre shows. No more Golden Mickey show, and the show replacing this was closed. The best food for lunch dinner would be at the Royal Banquet Hall. The Japanese Ramen set with chicken wings is value for money!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"581050063,5,2018-5,India,""Its a hyped park nothing as compared to the Disney in US or Paris . Ocean park is 1000 times better . Most of the rides are silly and in uncovered areas which can be difficult in summer . They don   t allow outside food and water but even when we are ready to pay exorbitant charges for lunch they provide a set Indian lunch which is tasteless and moreover we don   t have a choice . You have wait for at least half an hour in queue even for lunch !!!! Some of the rides were closed and there was no fire works on the day we went 14th May . Considering that fireworks are the must see , there was no announcement anywhere about its cancellation . Strictly avoid in summer and also during weekends . Don   t buy two day pass as one day is sufficient . Visit only if you are not planning to visit the US Disney otherwise nothing to talk about this one"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"580983877,2,2018-5,Macau,""Hong Kong Disneyland has the potential to be a really fun place, but it seems management is more concerned about cost cutting than guest experience. The park hours of operation are very short compared to Disney in USA. When they open the park at 10am, they don   t open the ENTIRE park. They open in sections which makes no sense to me. There are many outlets that have limited hours which makes it hard to even find a place to buy water.Come on HK Disney   focus on the experience of the guests. Don   t be so cheap. There is still some Disney magic here, but it could be so much better if management would focus more on the experience. Perhaps they should take their own family to experience it from the guest perspective and then they would realise how it is."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

This property is very small by Disney standards but as seniors, we were treated to all the park has to offer for a whopping entrance fee of $12 US. We rode the important rides and enjoyed the perfect weather. Get there when it opens to avoid the crowds. It's easy to get to by many transportation methods. We didn't find much to eat in the park? Perhaps the restaurants are all at the adjacent hotels. Naturally, the Disney standard of great staff and spotless grounds was evident.

The Disneyland station is cute! The Disneyland is not huge, but it is a good way to spend the day. There are many activities for kids, but not so many for adults. But just going through all the different parts of the park will take up a good amount of time.

"580315838,3,2018-4,Northern Mariana Islands,""We've been to Tokyo Disneyland, Anaheim Disneyland and Disneyworld in Florida. This is the least of my favorite of all the Disneyland we have visited. And I can safely say, it's the same for my 8 year old son. HK Disneyland was just too small to be very crowded and unorganized when we went (Spring break 2018). Staffs were unfriendly except the older ones. Very few seem to want to go out of their way to help esp. those who did not speak the language. We were looking for a autograph album for my son and no one seem to either know nor care. Sad. It's also dirty. Lots of trash on the floor esp. the bathroom. People are just too uncaring here including the patrons. The lines for everything was just too long to really enjoy your day. Even to get something to eat or drink. I mean, the line was mostly long in all Disneyland we went to esp. in Disneyworld but HK Disney was the worst. Maybe the lines here just bothered us more probably because people around us was just not happy or friendly. Not at all the happiest place in HK!My 8 year old was initially excited to be here.... but on the second day, I didn't even have to drag him out of the park. He was ready to leave by 4pm which I was not surprise at all. He was bored or a bit in a bad mood already towards the end. There was not a lot of Disney characters around and if there was, we didn't really know nor did we find them because of the unorganized structure or program. The rides was okay. We saw Black Panther and Ironman which was the highlight of my son's day hence I gave this park a 3 stars instead of 2. Lastly, there is absolutely no grand finale here   yes, there's the electric parade but no fireworks (castle was under construction). I mean, you would think they can move it somewhere at least or arranged for something special for grand finale to make up for the lost fireworks... no effort here, really.... which is a surprise   this is Disneyland after all!! Is it? Overall, it was a miss for us... I'm not sure if we would come back here again if given another chance... At of the moment, this visit was pretty  eh ... We didn't regret it all though because at least we can say we did went to HK Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"579818669,4,2018-5,United States,""We had a great time at Disney with our 15 month old. The park is much smaller than Shanghai Disney (where we went last year) but I actually like it that way because you don   t waste so much time walking between parts of the park. Really liked the food options. We ate at the Starlite Diner and the Corner Cafe   both infinitely better than food at SH Disney. As to be expected, all the cast members do a great job. We especially liked the Lion King show   it   s a cant miss show. One thing I was disappointed was HyperSpace mountain";" it could   ve been much better than it is.

We went on a Friday and the lines weren   t too bad. We enjoyed the high flying parade at 12:30 and were really impressed by the Festival of the Lion King show. My kids 5 9 all really enjoyed the Jedi training activity show. We tried to eat cheaply at snack stands   they only take cash. Overall a great experience. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"579707362,4,2018-4,United States,""Second visit to HKDL   Tips:(1) If you want a picture with Mickey & Minnie, they open Main Street before the park opening and they are together in the gazebo right bast the train station. Even arriving 15 minutes before park opening on a Saturday in late April, the line already took 1  hrs. Line appears deceivingly short   however, people in bigger groups want to take pictures in every fathomable combination, and there are  hidden  family members sitting on benches waiting to cut in at the last minute. You can also interact with the characters for longer than in the U.S. parks., so that's nice, but kind of painful for the people in line that are waiting.(2) Buy tickets on Klook   it's about $10 USD cheaper. Just show the confirmation on your phone at the front entrance, no need to print. Very reliable.(3) Workers do not seem to know about ingredients for food allergies (e.g. peanuts), which isn't as common in Asia as in the U.S.   so just look out for yourself and eat something safe.Overall, very fun park, less crowded than the U.S. Cute merchandise to buy   you can actually find nearly everything in the HK airport Disney Store."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

A place that you should not skip on visiting while you   re in Hong Kong. This is my 2nd time to visit but still I can   t get enough of it. The experience of singing with the casts while they are dancing and you dancing and swaying with them.

I'm 27 year old & staff played a very important role in making me happy. From getting me first wagon of every roller coaster to personalised meetings with the character to going out of the way only to get me polybags to carry my souveniers, Staff played a vital role. Thank you.Parades are beautiful.Rides are great !!And being the smallest DL, you have to walk a lot less compared to others.Absolutely least or NO Queues at all. Call me Lucky maybe :PWhy not to visit DisneyLand Hong Kong?If you don't care about Disneyland. Or you're quiet short on your visit.USEFUL TIPS   HACKS :Reach by 0930 at the gates, you'll be the first one to hop in.Do ask present staff at every ride for the first wagon, they will definitely agree if you're polite (at the most they will ask you to wait for the next ride).You can make your visit affordable by carrying snacks which are sealed & a water bottle too.Best rides ? Hyperspace Mountain ( Definitely for Star Wars fans & adults )"; it's a small World, Mystic Manor, River Cruise ( for kids );" Iron Man Experience & Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars ( every age )DO NOT MISS NIGHT PARADE.And If you wish to meet IRON MAN, go to Iron Man Tech Showcase ( Most people didn't know about this)CONCLUSION:Yes, I will visit again.

The 9yo probably had the most fun though!Weekend days are much busier than weekday.The only disappointments were probably the food selection and the Theatre. The food seemed a little limited and the quality was OK, but not as good as it could be. The theatre was disappointing as its mostly in Chinese. I get that probably most guests are Chinese, but it just left me feeling rather disappointed (there are English words projected on a highly visible screen however)The highlights for me are (Hyper)space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars, along with Mickey's Philharmagic. Its a Small World is a nice calm cool break from the outside world.The Jungle River Cruise has to get a mention, as the cast members always add a bit of fun and cheekiness to it. And Mystic Manor is goods fun too!If you love non stop ride action, getting fast passes is well worth it on the busier daysI havent been to any other Disney parks, but from what I know this is one of the smaller parks. You can do it in 1 day but 2 would also be fun. Its probably more suited to the younger kids (5 12) but with an open mind, anyone can enjoy!Transport options are plenty, with the MTR popular and easy.

One of them is french fries which I do not like much and the other one is some Chinese dish which I do not understand. The only option left with me was to toss and choose.

It has some different attractions to other parks and the three Disney hotels are within walking distance. Being small, during busy periods it can feel crowded although the locals do not seem to flock to the big fast rides, resulting in shorter wait times. We went in April and didn   t wait longer than 20 mins for anything. One thing to watch is food choice, which can be limited and very limited for vegetarians. The parades were good and easily visible without the US obligatory 1 hour saving spaces! All in all very much worth a visit.

577996381,5,2018-4,Australia,Although Hong Kong Disneyland is known as the smaller park I still loved spending two days here. I would recommend to do the younger kid rides first such as Pooh's adventures as these ones have the longest lines later in the day. The two main rollercoasters were always less then 10 minutes wait so don't rush to do these. The Lion King show is a must see! The songs and performances are next level with the majority in English. The parades are also magical and even without the castle it is a great experience for friends and families. Minimal vegetarian options (although the burger in Tomorrowland was great) and I wouldn't recommend the food voucher as it doesn't save you much money and limits where you can eat.

"577545614,3,2018-4,Philippines,""I'm a bit disappointed with my Disneyland trip this year because the castle and Main Street train station were under construction, and they closed the Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters ride, which was so much fun (despite it conking out more often)."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"577410326,5,2018-4,United States,""If you're an avid Disney fan, Hong Kong Disneyland is a fun way to spend a day during your time in Hong Kong. If you're used to Disney World in Florida, this park is teeny tiny compared to even just the Magic Kingdom in Florida. They have all your standard classic rides with some fun unique ones like Mystic Mansion. There's also some very different food choices at this park which reflect the flavors of Hong Kong and other Asian countries. The park is very easy to get to as it has it's own MTR line and stop. So check it out and have a magical day!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
577393558,4,2018-4,Philippines,Disneyland can be access via any sunnybay station and then transfer to disneyland train you can purchase your ticket in advance so you can go direct to turnstile mine i purchased via klook and you can show it via your mobile ticket suggest to be there as early as you can so you can try all the rides when you arrive at disneyland hop on the train so they can bring you half the park during our visit the castle is under renovation and some of the theme park is close overall it was a great visit in the happiest place on earth disney land ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"577393051,5,2018-4,Australia,""My husband, my 7yrs old and I loved disneyland. We went in the middle of the week so there were hardly any queues. We are not fans of big & fast rides so this was perfect for us.The jungle river cruise, Tarzan   s tree house, fantasy garden & it   s a small world was so much fun. Whatever you do, make sure you stay for the night parade"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"577386471,4,2018-4,India,""We went to celebrate our daughter's birthday and boy did she love it. The park was well managed, the staff (cast members as they call it) were everywhere to help and suggest. The Philhar Magic and the Lion King show were amazing for the kids. The kid did every ride but a must try is the Iron Man adventure, Grizzley bear train ride and the parades that were nice. Not as big as we were told it will be but overall a fun venue to spend a day or two as a picnic."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"577296948,5,2017-10,India,""It's a Experience to Magical Journey. From India, nearest Disneyland is in Hongkong, so selected this place. We stayed at Disneyland Hotel and visited the park for 2 Days. My daughter loved it. Starting from the room decoration to balloons to complimentary Mickey Mouse, everything was just perfect. Characters at breakfast table, having pic session with them was great experience. Overall hotel was great. Coming to the park, it caters to full family. I cannot do the rides, for people like me also so many shows were there. Great Experience, always will cherish."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"577208069,5,2018-4,United States,""We are regular visitors to Disneyland in California and have visited Disney World in Florida. Hong Kong Disney is smaller but worthwhile. This is our third visit. We feel it's great for younger kids as part of a trip to Hong Kong or nearby and for US Disney fans looking for something different yet familiar. These are some reasons why. Queues are a lot shorter than in US parks. Their most popular rides while we were there seem to be in Fantasy Land like Winnie the Pooh. Most other rides were walk on on weekdays. On weekends, longest wait we noted during peak time was ~30min but easy to avoid by going back in evening. We waited no longer than 5 10m for Mystic Manor and Iron Man in the evening. Iron Man, btw, is a simulation ride like Star Tours but BETTER!We also enjoyed the parades, especially the Spring Time Processional which featured different cast of characters like Judy Hopps, Nick the fox, and even Mary Poppins.We also like the variety of foods offered, a lot more diverse than in US parks. Several different Asian cuisines are represented, as well as American fare. This was a huge and fun difference to US parks. Though prices are still Disney high and quality to be expected which is not five stars in execution. Some may not care but bathrooms are important to me! And the few I went into were really clean, cleaner than in US parks. We paid    88usd for a two day pass, which is a lot cheaper than in the US. Even though park is smaller with less attractions, we were able to squeeze more rides in per day cuz queues were shorter. Though note that park closes early at 8:15 or 9:15pm. Transportation to the park was super easy and convenient via the HK subway system MTR. We took the MTR to Sunny Bay Station then transferred to the Disney Themed MTR direct to Disney Resort Area. I will review the resort hotel separately but want to note here that shuttle to fro park and hotel service do have minor areas of improvement."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"577195739,5,2018-4,United States,""I live in Orange County, California where the original Disneyland Park is located, and I have an annual pass. So I had to come here to take a look. It's very similar, with some minor differences. It's very clean, everything is basically new, and when I visited it wasn't crowded at all like the one in Anaheim. We took the MTR to Tsin Yi and then took the Disneyland line. It's really cute. The train, train station, and the area are all themed so if you're coming here with kids (we didn't... just adults who act like kids sometimes), it's all part of a nice big show."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

576998640,5,2018-4,Australia,Everyone is friendly and happy to help. The character greetings seem to be really popular with the (I assume) mainland Chinese so the rides aren   t as busy.

Noodles for 120 HKD and a Coke for 55HKDUnfortunately I could not see the castle because it was under renovation and construction.But in general, I had a wonderful time and enjoyed EVERY MOMENT of it.

"576397295,4,2018-4,New Zealand,""We have 3 children aged, 4,7,10. Great place to go when the kids are this age, you can get round the park in a day. Kids loved it, especially the rides. Make sure you use Fastpass to speed past the queues. Go to the big ticket rides during the parade as that's the quiet period for rides. NOTE you can't take your own food in so eat well before you go as food is a little pricy. Overall a good experience but if you have older kids they'll want bigger and more scary rides. Some activities for the kids we didn't do as they were mostly in Cantonese, which is understandable given our location, such as the Jedi Training School."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We used our priority pass to skip the line for the slinky dog ride. They let us sit in the ride then because their dad was with the toddler and did not get a cart behind or in front and we wanted to sit together, so we got off and waited for the next turn. Once we waited for the first round to end, we were told because they gave out the bone tickets for the round after, we had to wait one more round. So we would get on the third round. Finally, it was our turn then the staff proceed to say my five month old has to sit by herself on the seat and not on a lap, I got angry. I waited there for three rounds and even sat in a ride cart and not one staff says a word about my baby on my lap. Then when I was about to sit next to my family and enjoy the ride they tell me I can   t have my infant on my lap. She can   t even sit by herself. They did nothing but say she can ride if she sits by herself and that plenty of babies ( pointing to toddlers and pre school aged children saying those babies can do it, why can   t mine) as if blind to my child   s small size in comparison. I asked for a manager, while waiting the staff that let me on the ride then kicked me off ran away to hide.If they told me when they saw me in line they should have said something then everything would have been fine.

We went on a Tuesday morning and to our surprise there were no lines. The most we waited was ten minutes! The overall park was considerably smaller than the parks in the U.S.It's a Small World ride was a lot better than the rather boring ones in the U.S. The Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway MIne cars had a twist but won't spoil the surprise! We loved the Mystic Manor which was similar to the Haunted Mansion but more interesting. Toy Story Land was great and had cute rides. One of our favorite showcases involved a large book with characters portraying scenes from popular Disney movies. Some of the songs were sung in English or in Chinese.

My visit was during the schools Spring Break, so it was abnormally crowded for a Tuesday, but the cues were still tolerable for most of the rides.

For every attraction, the queue is a minimum of 15minutes. We weren't able to maximize our visit, a lot has been change since my last visit a decade ago.

Spent more than an hour to do so causing us to not able to go for some of the rides by the end of the day.My advice is to go here sometime 2023 onwards when their last addition (some new Marvel themed attraction) is scheduled to open."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"573180890,5,2018-4,Philippines,""Every visit is a great experience. It was our 4th visit and there are always something new to experience. Tomorrow land was the kids' favorite. It was great for Disney to include Star Wars and Iron Man experience. Though food is more expensive now compared to 3 yrs ago, there are also more to explore. One day is not enough to experience all the rides and attractions. Two days is a stretch and we were still not able to see everything. Tired feet but priceless smiles and wonder was well compensated. They never wanted to get out of Disneyland. Definitely a place to bring your kids and kids at heart."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"573071454,4,2018-4,China,""If you love Disney and Disneyland parks, yes you will still love it here as Disney just has that touch of magic. But if you   ve been to Orlando Disney parka in Florida and expect it to be of the same standard... not at all! This Disney Park is very small! The iconic sleeping beauty tower that is the central heartbeat to every Disneyland looks like it   s been put in the drying machine for a bit too long and has shrunk on every side! The fact you cannot are the castle from anywhere in the Park unless you   re in main street USA just tells you how small it is! If I am honest the park entry was far too expensive for what you get in return. Especially as they have now stopped the evening fireworks and there are not a huge amount of bigger rides and shows! Even worse because at the moment the main castle is under construction so is boarded up so you can barely see it even more so now! However, as my wife and I are still huge Disney fans we still ending up having a fantastic day on all the rides, watching the shows and parades and of course walking down Main Street USA singing along to the Disney music! As we went on a weekday too not in peak season the longest we queued for a ride was 20 minutes! Most rides we went on was a 5 to 10 minute wait! Perfect! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
572991611,5,2018-4,India,It   s awesome. One should definitely visit it. They have exciting thrilling rides. Kids will definitely love it. There is Disney parade which one should not miss it. Someone visiting HongKong has to visit this place,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
572821257,5,2017-11,United Kingdom,Hopefully I'll have the chance to visit here again. I was gutted I left my GoPro at my hotel. I was in a terrible mood the day I visited as I wasn't supposed to even be in Hong Kong. My connecting flight to Bali had been cancelled and I had to stay in Hong Kong for a few days. MY GOD I'm glad I did! This was amazing. Genuinely better for thrill seekers than Thorpe Park or Alton Towers. Some of the rides were truly incredible I was surprised they let 5 year olds on them! My personal favourite was Andy's race car. I went with 4 strangers who were supposed to be on my flight to Bali too   I made lifelong friends!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"572654190,5,2018-3,Philippines,""Went to Disneyland with the entire family and for 2 of our kids, it was their first time. We enjoyed immensely and stayed til the Parade.

"572457336,5,2018-1,India,""One of the very few Disneyworlds on the planet. Especially accessible to tourists from this part of the world. It would be a grave mistake to assume that this is for kids.

"572294343,3,2018-3,United Kingdom,""After already being lucky enough to go to Disneyland in Paris, Orlando and Los Angeles I don   t think it was ever going to come close to them but felt I had to at least give it a chance while I was there. Park tickets were cheaper than the others I had been to but the experience didn   t compare to the others. Food and drink was pretty expensive too. A bottle of Coke worked out to   3.70 and an Ice Cream (Best part of the day) was   4.50. The castle was so small too which I think they have now realised as they are redoing it which is causing some distribution to the park with boards up all around it. I   m glad I went to say I have been but I don   t think I would be recommending it. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"572223486,5,2018-3,United States,""My wife and I visited Hong Kong Disneyland in March 2018. It was not terribly crowded and its compact size made it easy to get around to all the attractions we wanted to experience. Also, the fact that we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel also made it convenient. There is a Disneyland local train the connects with the local subway system, making a trip into Kowloon simple and inexpensive. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. All of the Cast Members at the Park and Hotel were very friendly and spoke English. Being senior kids (over age 65), two day admission was less than $22 US.

Last part of journey is on a Disney MTR. If you buy your tickets from Klook on line it will save you 8% on ticket price and will get you straight in. We went on a Monday and the park was very quite walk on to Mystic Manor which is superb big grizzly mountain which was superb walked on three times.Hyperspace mountain only had five minutes que as did Iron man experience and it's a small world and jungle cruise . The only think not so good very expensive food and snacks and not much choice at park . Also lots off characters walking around for photos .If In Hong Kong highly recommend . ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The street parade at the start of the day is in one word  Spectacular  The characters and cast are really so into their performances, it makes you feel like you're watching a real princess prince  Tinkel Bell. We also once again loved the Lion King show, so colourful and energetic. They are currently renovating the Castle , so no fireworks show at the end, but the electric light show made up for that."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"571907252,4,2018-4,Australia,""We had a very enjoyable day out at HK Disneyland. The highlight was the Star Wars ride and the grizzly gulch ride. Early in the morning and later in the evening wait times for rides are 20 30 mins however early afternoon they were well over 50 minutes. The park is very clean with lots of stores and refreshment stands throughout   considering it's Disneyland, prices were not too bad for food and drink. I just wish the park felt more Disney   no characters wandering around as they are in their own sections where you have to line up to get a photo. The parade at the end of the night was nothing special and the music playing wasn't Disney themed.There are also no fireworks anymore and the castle is currently being renovated. Overall a very good day out, but could still be better!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

571393962,5,2018-3,India,had an amazing time here. Day well spend. You can easily block 1 entire day for Disneyland. Went with a 4 yr old but most rides were suited for the toddler. Buy tickets online for better deals,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"571371126,4,2018-4,Portugal,""The MTR directly to Disneyland Hong Kong is the best way to reach the park.Be aware at the long queues for entrance, even if you purchased your tickets online. Again, long queues for everything inside. Sometimes you questioned yourself why they don   t set a maximum number of visitors per day.. the night parade is a must see! Love it!Toilets very clean!Kids and adults having fun all day! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
571370861,5,2018-3,Australia,Went to Disneyland on a the Wednesday before Easter and found that the crowds were not as bad as I was expecting. The park opens at 10.00am however some of the lands within open at later times. The Disney app is worthwhile using as it has real time waiting times for the rides and attractions and also a GPS enabled map to get you around however as there are only wifi hotspots unless you have data the app will drop out when there is no wifi. Make good use of the FastPass options as this can save time in queues but remember that you can only have one pass at a time and cannot get another one until after a specified time which is on your ticket. Plenty of food options available and souvenir stores and carts are everywhere. Stay for the Disney Paint The Night Parade at the end as this is well worthwhile. Get a position at the end of Main Street and watch the parade come to you. Also lets you get out of the park as soon as the parade has ended to get to the station ahead of the crowd. There were several areas under maintenance on the day that I was there however still plenty of other things to see and do. I had a great time and would recommend kids (and adults) of all ages to go.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"571257877,4,2018-4,Singapore,""Disneyland around the world still gives off a magical vibes despite the size! Sleeping Beauty's castle was cordoned off for maintenance so that was a bummer but apart from that, all rides are open. I went in during the opening time and I left before 3pm after finishing all the rides I wanted to take (which is the adult ish rides)Around 2pm, queues were forming so if you guys wna spend half a day in Disneyland, just head there early.Also, HK Disneyland has a mobile app which is very convenient so you don't have to hold on to the park map. That app tells you the waiting time of the attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping etc. Pls download it!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
571170469,3,2017-7,Hong Kong,Hong Kong Disneyland as I think is the smallest Disneyland in the world. Its very crowd and everything need to queue for an hour.

"571127274,4,2018-3,Australia,""We spent 1 1 2 days here and had a great time! The queue times were quite short waited 20 mins at the most both days. Our boys are 7 & 12 and their favourite rides were Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man, RC Racer and Mystic Mountain. We were on these many times! We had purchased some kids meal vouchers from Klook which ended up being a waste of money. There are only a few locations you can use them and only 1 meal option at each so not a lot to chose from. So would not recommend these vouchers. There are a number of eateries at the park and the food was good. It's a great day out for a family! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"571123247,4,2017-7,Hong Kong,""For our 18th wedding anniversary, I decided to keep us local and to take my husband and our 2 teens to Disneyland. In the past we've gone to Macau for the weekend. We've lived here in Hong Kong for over 10 years and had never been to Disneyland, so it was well over due.I splurged on connecting rooms in the nicest resort, and they did not disappoint. The view, the spaciousness, the service, all Top notch!We were very well taken care of in the Kingdom Club, though the resort did not cater to relaxing adult time. If we wanted to have a cocktail before dinner, we had to sit in our room. The Sea Breeze lounge by the pool was closed the whole weekend, and so drinks by the poolside meant going through room service and it took 30 minutes. And ordering drinks at dinner, including Cokes for the kids, needed to be very strategic as it could take upwards of 15 20 minutes. The whole resort seems very accustomed to a mainland Chinese clientele, but we could tell the manager was looking after us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The sense of playfulness and whimsy about the place is infectious, so we all really did enjoy our time there.All in all, I'm glad we went, but for the price, we could have gone to Thailand, to be honest. We had a lovely time, everybody was very nice, and the hotel and our rooms were gorgeous, but there's no desire by either of us to go back again. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"571055253,5,2017-10,Macau,""I visited this place with my family. The children had the most amazing time. The first time we visited was on a weekend and it was really crowded. We visited the second time and we scheduled on a weekday and it's all worth it. The parade was awesome! The floats are designed grand and costumes are really amazing. Everyone is happy!!! The most awaited part was the fireworks display, lovely. It's well recommended for families with children. Must visit during winter. Avoid during summer because it's really hot!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"571010042,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,""You are never too old to enjoy the wonders of Walt Disney. However, Hong Kong Disneyland does seem to cater for a younger and less thrill seeking visitor so for those wanting big rides and thrills at every turn then this may not be the place for you. Only purchase a one day pass as this place can be easily done in half a day and remember that the weather is hot and humid so beware! The queues are relatively small, in fact we walked straight to the front on nearly every ride but I would suggest getting there at open time to avoid any queues but more importantly, avoid the temperatures. Make sure you check out the times for meeting the characters. We were rather surprised by how accommodating the characters were in the sense that they spent a lot of time with each visitor or family and happily posed for numerous phones and cameras and various poses. We would suggest getting in the queues for the characters at least 10 minutes before but the queues for Minnie and Mickey are long so get there early!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
570966932,4,2017-12,Singapore,The Disneyland was true enough smaller than the rest of the Disneylands. Queue guide was good. Usually shorter than what they stated. Good for kids above 8.

"570886770,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,""Given several visits to Disney   s US based attractions I was generally impressed with their Asian version. Rides stayed true to the originals while paying a bit of homage to new ideas....we absolutely loved Hyperspace Mountain, Grisley Gulch, and It   s a small world. Very easy to get around and I think they did an exceptional job of making sure the attractions were still enjoyable for those who spoke any English.Only complaints are that I found their WiFi to be very spotty and slow, which Impacted our ability to use the app, and the times listed on line lengths were very inaccurate.The folks on Disney   s property seemed to implement Disney   s traditional atmosphere of hospitality....the same can   t be said for the transportation segment on the way there....we found the bus driver to be very disinterested in answering a simple question...A good experience overall....not as good as the original but a very good representation for Asia."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Children or adults, everyone has something to do. Each Disney character has a space, music, rides and even dressed up live characters in some cases. The evening parade is like life enters these characters and then ends with fireworks over the Disney castle!

"570288550,3,2018-4,Hong Kong,""For hardcore fans, I don   t have to say anything, they will go no matter what I said.

The place will be all packed withChinese tourists.Second, IMO, please don   t go on a hot summer day (which is like mid May to early Oct) It is so so hot and humid. Imagine waiting in line with bunch of sweaty people all day.Well, that leaves us on Nov, Dec, March and April, which you get the best weather, less pack.Third, buy the fast pass even if you are going on the months I suggested.

"569904547,1,2018-3,Philippines,""We went there March 31,2018. I was with my 6 yr old child. When she saw the stormtrooper mascot she was very excited to go there. We ran towards the stormtroopers and she happily raised her hand and waiting to be called. They were pointing out children or couple who will have a chance to have photos with them. My child kept on raising her hand and we were there standing for almost 20minutes. My child didn   t want to go until she was called. But I   m so tired and so I told her to go to Storm Troopers directly thinking that they will allow her since they kept on grabbing couples    who didn   t wait there   , children who just    passed by    or children who doesn   t want to have photos with them but apparently she was turned down by that stupid Storm Tropper assigned on March 31,2018 around 4pm. For just taking a photo with my child who   s only dream was to go to Disneyland made her cry because the mascots wanted to just grab people who didn   t even    wait   ! Isn   t it that HongKong Disneyland is really for kids and they think that it is the    happiest    place on Earth and staffs should make everybody happy?! That stupid Storm Tropper made my child cry and hurt her feelings! It was ok if we were rejected because we didn   t wait there for too long. But we did! We waited Soooooo long! We waited more than 20minutes for just a photo to make a child happy. With just a click and less than a minute they can already make somebody happy but that stupid Storm Tropper rejected because they wanted those who didn   t WAIT. If we were celebrities they would allow us fast but we were not! I suggest to have a new policy with the mascots! All the mascots should have a line to take photos and everybody should have a chance especially those who    WAITED   . we paid so much more that we deserve that right to have a photo with whoever we want.

The hardware is there as it   s standardised globally   however on the soft services, I find it difficult to have rests in between rides (the wait for each of the rides could be as long as 30  minutes). Not that many vendor choices for quick rests. Number of washrooms are available but some require lengthy walks   so not the most convenient for children of younger ages. Majority of the resting seats in the parks are fully exposed under the sun without shades so it could be easily sunburned if visit the park without hats or umbrella. Majority of the F&B stops do not offer A C (but is open air) so it can be unbearable during heated summer time   do come prepared with light clothes and umbrella, hats, sunglasses and sunblocks. We already tried to beat the crowd by being the first to arrive the park, but more than a dozen tour groups arriving with large tour buses also planned the same and their stops are immediately in front of the park entrance whereas for private car park guests would need to walk further to arrive the entrance   just be mindful to wear very comfortable shoes as a lot of walking is required during the entire visit.

There is a lot of walking from one end to the other made a little more inconvenient because it   s so far and fantasyland castle is closed.

"568584435,4,2018-3,Kenya,""I visited Hong Kong Disneyland during a week day and it was not that crowded which allowed me to enjoy the visit. One whole day trip ticket includes entry to all the events and it is not that expensive. Small World, Train ride, Boat ride, Roller coaster rides (even though I got freaked out!) are worth enjoying. As to any other Disneyland, the most interesting part is to attend the Night Parade. There is a day parade in the afternoon and a night parade with illumination. Unlike Tokyo Disneyland where one day visit may not be enough, we can cover almost all the rides in Hong Kong Disneyland in one day. Worth the visit."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The club lounge is also really great with a lot of food to choose from for the evening canap  s and breakfast. They have the mickey waffles and cookies !!The room is huge with a spacious balcony with very nice view of the sea. Just feel like sitting there for hours sipping coffee.

"567862969,5,2018-3,United Kingdom,""On the last day in Hong Kong before flying home (at midnight!) we decided to make the most of our time and visit Disney land. We are an English couple in our 30's and arrived and opening and left at closing after the final parade.It's very easy to get to on the MTR or by taxi   we stayed in Mong Kok and it was $200 (about   20) in a taxi and we got the train back which was about   5 for 2 people.There was plenty to see and do for all ages and the park is a really nice size where you can see most things in 1 day.There aren't many thrill rides but the RC Car and Starwars ride were nice and fast and we went on a few time. Nice surprise was the Madhatters tea cups where you can manually control how fast it spins   probably my favorite ride of the day.Food options were really good and lots of things to buy. Fantastic way to maximise our last day, had a fantastic time."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"567854171,4,2018-3,Singapore,""HKDL is a small park and with the construction going on, feels even smaller. It's a good park for families with little kids, or if you just want to tell people that you've been to Disneyland.We were there over a weekend in March. It wasn't very packed but it was quite busy as it was the start of their Springtime event. Most of the rides wait times were around 20 30 minutes, with it being noticeably longer on the Saturday. The park still uses paper fast passes, and only for a few rides. They make nice souvenirs though, so you can collect and keep them instead :)The rides and shows can be done in one full day but if you want to do the character meets, it will take you 2 days to cover everything. 2 days tickets only cost a little bit more than a 1 day ticket.Iron Man Experience was interesting, I liked that it was both in Cantonese and English. I'm not sure if they had multiple versions like in Star Tours. And it really made me want to eat dim sum.The best reason to visit HKDL : there is halal food and a prayer room available. The variety of food has increased and now the Main Street Marketplace (the little snack shack in between the Main Street Bakery and the Chow Tai Fook jewelery store) is also certified halal and sells (wait for it) HALAL TURKEY DRUMSTICKS. So friends, we must support, OK?The park sells meal vouchers for a discount, and while it looks like a good deal, I find it quite difficult to eat 2 square meals as their meal portions are sensibly large. Fortunately, we had Magic Access which offered a 25% discount off dining, and used that instead.The fireworks show has ended since the castle is being torn down, and instead they do a projection show down Main Street. Mickey makes an appearance at the end of the street near the central gazebo and we love the Mickey shaped confetti.Unlike Tokyo and Anaheim, HKDL opens later, which is nice because you can sleep in. There is a priority entrance for visitors with Platinum Magic Access and hotel guests, which is nice because the lines are always shorter."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fast track pass kiosk are located besides those specific key rides. you just need to scan you ticket to get your free fast track pass, which will allot you specific time. you can enjoy other rides and come back these rides at your allotted time, without much queuing up.

"567234817,5,2018-2,United States,""I loved this smaller version of Disneyland. They had some really new and different rides, along with some of the older, traditional rides. We went at the end of Chinese new year and still the lines were not too bad, especially in the morning. I recommend you arrive prior to opening as the crowds were really light at that time of day.Being from the US, it was pretty much what I expected...same Disney feel, Asian food of course which was great. We stayed about half the day and we were able to ride most of the attractions. Attractions like the Jungle Cruise were done in several different languages, you just need to get in the line for english speakers is that's your language."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
567146658,5,2018-3,Singapore,Way less crowded than in Tokyo but much smaller. The fun rides for teens like Space Mountain and Mine ride had relatively short queues. Iron Man 4d was not bad too and there is a pretty fun ride in Toy Story land too. The rest of the rides are for kids like Mystic Manor but not bad either.

We went on a Sunday and it was surprisingly busy considering it was February.Loved how the park was set out and lots of different things compared to the other Disney parks.Mystic manor was amazing also the Grizzly Gulch are was so well themed. The castle was unfortunately boarded up which we knew before so the fireworks were not on the night we were there. Both the parades were lovely and the staff were so organised and polite to everyone.So glad I got to experience the park and would definately recommend for all disney fans.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Amazingly we were able to ride all the rides were wanted, last time even twice a couple of them. The longest wait time was 30min. This is so much better in comparison to Disney in USA where you could stand 60 to 90 min line! Note we do always come early, right after it opens so I'm sure this helps however we stay until about 4pm to watch the parade which is very cute and uplifting. The food is of course quite expensive everywhere but decent. And plenty of opportunities to satisfy sweet cravings with ice cream, waffles, churros and more. Of course there are plenty of souvenir shops to buy gifts for everyone : ) Overall I really like how this Disneyland is compact so you could go around it in a half day, no stress and no huge crowds (of course this is Hong Kong so people are everywhere still but not crazy).

Also, there was a lot of construction, with the castle and several other areas cordoned off. I estimate 10% of the park was closed, so not happy to be charged full price, added to the early closing of stalls and shows. Not to Disney standards.

Checked the website not much info. Reached there day started well at new Star Wars attraction and iron man show but soon discovered attractions like mystic point supposed to be brand new down Down due to technical error and Lion king show was also closed and toy story parachute ride was also closed. Mind you these are all star attractions! How can a park charge full admission when three star attractions are closed??!! This resulted in crazy queues by mid afternoon bec each ride show you can imagine should have been able to take a few hundred people off the track at each point!!! We left by 430 after the parade bec the crowd had gotten to the point of ridiculous. Sure people can fit into the park but with major rides closed this is not fair to paying customers flying in from overseas!!! A partial discount or meal vouchers should be offered when more than one major attraction is closed. Disappointed and unlikely to come back again.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We worked our way from F Land to Toy World, kids go nuts. Then went through Wild West where Grizzly ride is. Tarzans Tree Touse was ok., to get there was a short trip over canal. Not alot of eateries no Down Town Disney here. Small World was really good.

"563138984,4,2018-2,United Kingdom,""My 4 and 6 year old children love Disney so where better than the happiest place on Earth. My 4 year old is 102cm exactly so we were still able to get on quite a few rides. HK Disneyland is incredibly easily accessible via MTR with a Mickey themed MTR train. But this time we chose to drive and it costs HKD220 to park the car for the day. The roads were very easy to navigate and the car park was near to empty, arriving at noon we parked in bay 5. The park was quite quiet and we had to wait no longer than 30 minutes for the rides which was perfect for us. We didn   t plan our day very well and missed the lion king show but were able to catch all the other shows. Even though HK Disneyland isn   t very big we still didn   t have enough time to get around all of the park. We missed out Adventureland. The rest of the park was well thought out, well presented and easily accessible. The toilets were well placed throughout the park. They were all clean with toilet paper and hand paper was available (locals will know this is rare!). There was also a choice of regular toilets or squat toilets. Every toilet we visited had baby changing facilities. We knew in advance that the fireworks had been cancelled so we weren   t disappointed. We used the time to go on extra rides until the park closed at 9pm. As with any Disney attraction the food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced. We still had some snacks from the many food stalls and also ate the set dinner at the Plaza Inn. The part that made the day really special for us was that my 6 year old was approached by a staff member to take part in the princess parade. For this she was sat in a prime seating area (only one parent was allowed to accompany her) to watch the parade and join in the dance with the Disney princess float. It truly made the visit memorable. Thank you Disneyland HK for making our visit so special!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We arrived at 930 and had no delays getting into the park.if you can buy (fast pass easy pass) tickets already along with your entry. Yes a little more money but well worth it. Every body has there own likes but the iron man and Star Wars rides are great. Even some of the rides shows that we weren   t really interested in , we went on(because of fast pass tickets) and surprisingly we enjoyed them.

The attractions are mostly geared toward smaller children but the park is well maintained and easily do able in a single day if you use FastPass. (You get 3 Fast Passes with a general admission ticket). The Lion King theater show was particularly good. Best of all, a regular ticket is about $75 US, and if you are over 65 it is about $13 US.

All that being said, I found Disneyland Hong Kong to be my least favorite of the four I've visited. Maybe my expectations were a bit too great, but I found that it's a little small feeling, and it seems like there are fewer attractions and definitely fewer shows than other Disney properties. The things that they do have are really good, but we were pretty well done before the sun went down on our one day visit. If it's your only Disney opportunity, definitely go. If you love Disney definitely go. Just know what to expect."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"561064503,4,2017-10,United States,""We've been to both Orlando Disney and Tokyo Disney and had heard that Hong Kong was no match for either of them. We went into the park with low expectations. There were definitely some downsides to the park, but for the most part, we left feeling pleasantly surprised. THE RIDESAll the rides are super fun and innovative, and even the big ones have short lines (30 minute wait at the VERY most, but usually 10 minutes). They are exciting enough for the older ones (my teenage granddaughter loved all the rollercoasters, the new Iron Man simulator, and the Mystic Manor trackless ride  so did my 40 year old children, in fact!) but also appeal to the younger ones and have low height restrictions so my 5 yo granddaughter was able to ride EVERYTHING in the park (a first for her). THE SHOWSWe watched a live performance of Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The visuals were stunning, performances were great. Tiana stole the show with Almost There, but I must say that Elsa disappointed with Let it Go, the performer was NOT a strong singer. The dialogue was in Chinese but with English subtitles. THE FOODMeh, especially for the prices  although you MUST try the caramel popcorn! Meal vouchers are a good idea and saved us 12 bucks (USD) and we got 3 vouchers for caramel popcorns with the meal vouchers. I recommend eating at the Explorer's Cafe. THE SERVICEAlso meh, especially after having visited Tokyo Disneyland and WDW in Orlando. People did not go out of their way to assist us as in the other Disney parks. Other guests were visibly cutting in line but the Cast Members turned a blind eye. Overall, it's definitely worth a trip. If you go in the off season, you'll experience short lines and be able to do the entire park easily in a day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"560956841,4,2018-2,Russia,""We have been to this Disneyland twice. So, tried all adventures for adults and for babies this time.

There is a wonderful attractions for the children of 1,5 4 years as fantasy land, Pooh   s house, orbitron, jungle cruise and many others. A lot of interesting small spots to discover fairy tails. So, if you have children below 6 years old they will love it. For adults I would recommend to visit Ocean park, it if more interesting. Also I would like to note, that it is quite hard to buy healthy food for the baby on the territory of park, we have seen mostly sweets, cakes, etc. so it is better to take something with you. It will be great if some healthy food cafe will appear in the park. Most part of visitors are from China, though all attractions are mostly in English. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"560829232,5,2018-2,India,""The dilemma:Whether to take the two day pass or one day pass? Looking at reviews feedback, I took one day pass. In hindsight, it was a wrong decision. I went with a 8 year old kid and her pace is not the same as mine. With a 2 day pass, I could have covered all the rides in a relaxed manner. The cost of two day pass is only little bit more than one day pass and it is a good deal.Positives:  Paint the night parade is superb.  This was my first Disneyland trip. I realized that Disneyland is not about high tech rides. Much more thrilling high tech rides can be had in any big city around the world. Disneyland is about carefully curated fantasy. It is not to be rushed through but savoured slowly. The 19th century USA ambience is created beautifully with attention to details. Roaming through these does not need any queue.  Once paint the night parade is over, one can return to city by MTR or taxi. There are folks at taxi stand (possibly Disneyland staff) who really help.Negatives:  I wish some people could have taken things a bit more easy. It should not be about ticking away a bucket list of rides, cutting queues, covering most rides in minimum time. I can understand the excitement of kids but I cannot understand the impatience of parents. Why create the unnecessary scarcity mentality?"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The rides are fun, the shows are great, the characters mascots are lovely, the staff are friendly, the amenities are very good, the parades and fireworks display are mesmerizing, etc. Two or three things, however, are quite disappointing in this place: first, the unbearably long queues to the rides and shows";" second, the lack of discipline of the local visitors concerning hygiene and trash disposal: and, third, the humidity. Having a fast track ticket doesn't really help that much. You'll have to get a schedule just the same.

Kids there are extremely rude and pushy, constantly cutting in line, and the parents don   t seem to care at all. I ended up yelling at a few and blocking them from cutting. The food is by far the most expensive out of the 3 Asian disney parks, and the worst. PhotoPass   NOT worth the money. All other parks had photopass photographers throughout the park.

Its awsome we hardly cued up for anything.Most see is the night paraid at 8:00 pm no matter how tierd you are, to get the nest position Stand near the passage ways the staff keeps open   once the parade is near they close them So you can get in on first line to get the best view ( youll know what i mean when your there )"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is something for everyone ranging from adventure, nature, parks, gardens, fun rides, roller coaster rides, 4D theatres and the like.

That just wasn   t to happen until much later as there were virtually no dining places open, in fact some didn   t open until noon & some didn   t open at all. The park is TINY. I couldn   t believe how quickly we got around it, possibly due to the fact that a few attractions were closed (Castle, Buzz, Train etc), so we were done in no time at all.  60 was definitely a big price to pay for the disappointing experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"558956684,4,2017-7,India,""Every child's dream even some grown up childrens dream";"DISNEYLAND! It's dianey, so it's a total delight. As usual it's expansive, fun, tiring in a good way but Hong Kong tends to get pretty, so ideally should visit it in winter. And the staff, right from the luggage check in to ticketing is pretty rude unnecessarily. So the trip starts with a bad taste but you kinda forget all that once inside. It's Disney. One tip, do not carry even a medium size backpack. You'll have to leave it outside with no proper storage facility provided. It's kinda off putting, and very Unprofessional.Oh yeah the train that takes you Lantau Island where is Disleyland is situated is dedicated to Disney, so your experience starts, the moment the train comes in. Pure childhood bliss. The train is full of Disney details and artifacts. Once you reach the station, the old world charm exudes a spell on you. It's beyond words, you need to experience it yourself. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
"558940615,4,2018-2,Malaysia,""This is my first Disneyland. Bought ticket from Klook for the convenience. There was still a long queue getting in at 10:00 on a Thursday. Like everyone else, we took the special Disney train from Sunny Bay. We thought we were too early when we got there before 09:30 but a huge crowd was already waiting. So we waited in line. The gate opened at 10:00 but we were only allowed into the game area at 10:30.Our first stop was the Iron Man ride. Some people actually took the fast pass and went ahead to other rides. Thought that it is smart to get fast pass for the few rides that offer this. We didn't attempt to do it. The queue probably took 15 minutes. Then we entered the special ride area with our 3D glasses. The ride was fun, one of the best, but rather short. Next we tried the Mystic Manor. There was no queue. While I enjoyed the ride, it was even shorter than the Iron Man ride. The other highlight was the show   Mickey and the Wondrous Book. We lined up for an hour before we could get in. The line was badly managed. The moment we were allowed to go inside the compound for another queue, kids and parents started running in, ignoring the initial queue. It was frustrating. The show lasted 28 minutes. The other attractions we tried were Tarzan's tree house, Disneyland railroad, It's a small world, The many adventures of Winnie the Pooh (not worth the hour long queue), Slinky Dog Spin and Mickey's PhilharMagic (nice 3D show). By afternoon, more people turn up, leading to long queues at all the attractions. Some additional information:1. Avoid the fried noodle from the stalls if possible.2. Download the Disneyland apps. It provides information on queue time and also rides that may not be opened. We found out beforehand that Hyperspace Mountain was not available when we were there. 3. Queue wisely. Sadly there are always individuals who try to cut queue discreetly.4. Toilets are well maintained and clean. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
558937927,4,2017-3,Malaysia,Visited with younger son. He enjoyed the most and was taking pictures with his favorite cartoon characters.   It is easy to reach by public transport (sky train).,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"558932183,4,2017-7,India,""Well   . visiting Disney Land for the first time itself sounds absolutely Thrilling!!It   s kind of more for kids and family entertainment. It was an amazing experience for us though. But for hard core rides & coaster lovers I guess this place won   t work for u guys. However, reaching there wasn   t a task for us as we stayed on Lantau Island itself and the journey from hotel to the park was too short coz our hotel provided shuttle to Disney land which got us there in just 15     20 mins, while people travelling from other places will take more time than usual but its hassle free, MTR which is the second best option I would suggest, because while returning we missed our shuttle, we had to travel through MTR and it was a nice experience.The fountain of Mickey on a giant whale was quite welcoming. Especially kids, you could see the excitement in them watching those Disney characters. There was a live Mickey and Mini interaction when we entered and clicking pics with them which gave a kick start to the day. The rest of the rides were nice and we enjoyed a lot. Also, would suggest to make proper use of maps and the timings mentioned on it for the rides so that you don   t miss any being Sunday the wait time was not more than 15     20 mins.One small disappointment for us was the food coz being an Indian we would prefer Asian or Indian meal but we couldn   t found any options other than European food, especially after those tiring activities anyone would wish to have a meal of their choice. Also, the Indian restaurants that were shown on map were all shut and there was no update regarding the same coz it was far and we had to search walking which was very time consuming.But at the end the very famous Disney Fireworks (09:00 pm) a not to be missed stuff, is a treat to the eyes and it makes you forget the entire day   s tiredness.Over all experience was wonderful and would really suggest to visit once in your life."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Lot attractions are more for girls and then boys    attractions were jammed pack with over 60 mins queues.So I must say if you have daughter then dress her to princess & she will love this castle.By 4 pm, we realised we have to split with 2 kids to complete this.So I took 2 year old in train elephant ride horse carousel & few other kiddies rides.He enjoyed lot.These was age appropriate but then why would you go to Disneyland for those rides for almost $90Aud? 5 yo couldn   t go in star war miles from tomorrow land & few water rides only because of endless queues.You have to miss one or other for older kids.We have been to movie world sea world & dream world in Goldcoast, AUS & paid lesser for 3 theme parks then HK Disneyland.Also food was expensive inside.Overall, Perfect for girls for sure.My 5 year old said, movie world was better then this."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"558125436,5,2017-8,Pakistan,""Disneyland Hongkong is very attractive theme park. It is a must see attraction if you are in Hongkong. Children will love to visit. Several attractions are there for kids. I will suggest to buy Disney Souvenirs should be purchased from any market in city. If you purchase it from Disneyland it will cost very high. So better purchase any rain coat, umbrella or Disney cap outside of the Disneyland. Fast pass price has several benefits. it saves time. If you are with little kids you may need fast pass because on most of the rides there is a lot of rush. so kids either get irritated in long queues or they miss some rides. Tips for visitors:1) Avoid visiting on sundays or holidays. There will be a lot of rush. Local tourism is china is very high. Locals visit to these attractions so try to avoid visiting on holidays or festival days to save your time and visit with peace of mind. 2) Go to the place as early as possible. Early in the morning there is no rush so if you want to enjoy all rides without fast pass you can do it easily. Fast pass price is very high Disney should slash the price."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

558053759,4,2018-1,Germany,Disneyland is always worth a visit. It is a small park and you should be able to visit the majority of the attractions on one day.

"558000357,4,2018-2,New Zealand,""I went with my friend 1 Feb 2018 and we are both mid 20's. Was cool to experience a Disneyland. Some good things: the wait times were fantastic. The most we waited for a ride would have been 30 minutes. The rides were all really well put together and bought the characters to life.  It's a small world  and the  Pooh Bear  were my personal favourites, plus make sure you wait around for the end of day parade the lights in this are amazing and very good.Some not so great points: food variety wasn't amazing, there wasn't a heck of a lot of vegetarian meal options and the snacks and meals were very expensive (I would recommend taking in a lot of food for snacks especially if you have kids). There weren't enough characters throughout the park during the day. We only managed to see three characters, and we were there from open til close. Some of the park just looked a little bit tired and unpolished. Also some of the main characters were no where to be seen within the park and rides. Pocahontas is my fave Disney character and the only time I saw here was a small figurine in the  It's a small world  ride, also no merch for her.

We had spent a day at Ocean Park the day before and had read that it was better than Disney, so were a little worried, but nothing could be further from the truth.We'd also been to Paris Disney, and this is absolutely comparable. The Disney experience with the Asian touch is really spectacular. I'd recommend making the most of the fast pass, which you can use once at every ride (no additional cost).We were able to get through the entire park in one day, but it was a very busy day   non stop. The food isn't great, and typically over priced, but that wasn't surprising.The rides are all great   favourites were Iron Man experience and Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"556831717,5,2018-1,India,""This was our second visit to Hong Kong Disneyland, the first one being in December 2010 and it was a pleasure to experience the new rides and shows. The best part about Disney is that it never disappoints no matter how high your expectations are set at! We took the 2 day Play and Shop package which I believe is only available online and is serious value for money. You can make the second visit anytime within 6 or 7 days of the first visit! My parents who are close to 70 basically paid only 100 HKD per person per day which is 1 6 of an adult ticket price. The kids loved almost all the rides and characters. Food options could be better but then who goes to Disneyland to eat? Get to the park 15 minutes before it opens and start from the Adventure Land side. We did that on day 1 and it worked better than the other way around that we tried on the second visit. We skipped weekends. Do not miss the parades (there are 2 in a day, both totally different), Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Manor, Space Mountain and Iron Man rides especially if you have kids over 10 with you. Highly recommend shows such as 1) Mickey and the Wondrous book and 2) Phillar magic! Its a small world is good for older people and is generally not too busy.

The only thing that was terrible was that there were absolutely no options for vegetarian food. Absolutely none except some corn. Now, if you   ve set up a world famous theme park, people from all over the world are going to come. There would be so many who may look for veg food. It   s not a localized theme park which will be visited by locals only. And in this part if the world visitors from India will be so many. Needs so more thought on that one !!

We left our kids lunch box in the fridge in the Kingdom Club. When we are back to our Deluxe room, the Club   s housekeeping was so kind enough to put the lunch box into our new room fridge. (contains our kids cheese). We also got the luggage shifted to our Deluxe room. Very convenient and thoughtful.When I reached the hotel after the park day 1, we also got surprised with 2 Mickey Mouse plush toys, a bunch of Helium Balloons, birthdays cards from Mickey, cake decor with towels and decorations in our rooms.Our kids (son and daughter) loved the plush soft toy from the    Three Magical Days    package. Our daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse and when I asked the front desk helped me to changed it, it was changed immediately without any queries. My daughter was so excited and she was sleeping hugging the Minnie the whole night.We were late from the Disney park after the Night parade and headed to Walt   s cafe for dinner. We have been provided food and table at around 10 pm without any hassle. The staff and the restaurant was so efficient and fast and also very knowledgeable in the menu. The staff also advised me about the dinner promotion of discount of $100 for $400 minimum spend. We   ve got that discount and a great dinner.

Chips, cookies, candies were okay. Drinks were also allowed. My tip is to buy water outside before going there as the price inside is much higher.

The day pass was quite pricey so you need to go early and stay till they close to make it worth it. Going there early during the week can avoid the crowds, which usually starts around 1pm. Even the place is small, there are still a good number of rides to play at the park. The kids wanted to see the castle and we walked down the main street to get to the rides. Our route was Main Street    Tomorrowland     Fantasyland    Toy Story Land     Adventureland. Had lunch at Starliner Diner...very expensive for low quality food! Some people brought snacks for their lunches. Wish we had done that too.Played a few more rides after lunch and we left the park at 6pm. Totally forgot about the traffic. The trains were packed!!! If you don't have a stroller but you have young kids, you can rent a stroller for HK$120 per day with HK$100 refundable deposit.

555848329,3,2018-1,Singapore,First time to any Disney Park. Was expecting it to be magical but we found the place somewhat muted.Maybe it was the crowd. We even saw a kid peeing at the sidewalk. It wasn   t as crowded as we thought but it may be even worse during peak season.Food was horrendous. Keep bumping into the smoking corners as well. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"555814792,5,2017-12,India,""I've never been to any of the Disneyland. It was my first time I visited the place in Hongkong, The place is very happening, beautiful and well designed, the time you step you into the place, you will get into the delightful memories of your childhood. I went to the place during Christmas which made my experience better. The place is very crowded so I recommend to take a 2 day pass if you are planning to go especially on weekends or public holidays so you can enjoy the most of it. Don't forget to attend the evening firework and Disney parade. They have dedicated mobile applications which will give you an idea about the timetable and wait time on rides."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
555787849,5,2018-1,India,HK Disneyland is small as compared to US one but it is worth it. This is a must visit for a child(once in a lifetime). The shows and Parades should not be missed. The Iron man Experience is a new addition which should be in a must do list.The characters at Main Street looks so real and reminds us of very fond memories of the past.Travel in a weekday to avoid the queue and rush.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"555723927,4,2018-1,United States,""Four people three generations all adults. Love this happy place! We live in the northeast part of US. Visited Disneyland and Disneyworld at Florida and CA many times. Each time involved plane ride and long traveling time and hotel expense. Not this one. It was so easy to get to! 40 minutes train ride and here it was! The last part of the train ride (the ride that dedicated to go to Disney) was a pleasant surprise: the cabin was decorated with playful color and lovely designed seats. Never seen before. And there were rides that were uniquely Hong Kong Disney too. We enjoy them all. Even my 80 years old mother in law got onto the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars twice! I am a clean freak and all facilities plus overall park maintenance earn high my marks. It was a weekday and a bit rainy. Not crowded, which contribute to the easy and relax and cleanliness. But not happy that some places were closed, such as the castle and small world and many restaurants. Plus no firework. That took one point away from rating. Oh try the turkey by the food stand at the main street. Not as good as in CA but good enough if you miss turkey. It was 3 times bigger than the display. Do not let the display fool you. Finally have to praise all the workers. They were very professional and pleasant and did the right thing when they saw people cutting line."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"555700201,4,2018-1,United Kingdom,""This is the 5th Disneyland I have been to. Once again it   s an unmistakable Disney experience but it   s quite small relative to other Disney   s.I guess we were in the off season (January) but we only waited for more than 10 minutes on one ride (Parachute Drop was 20 mins), but most were less than 5 mins.As for characters there was a queue to meet Mickey Minnie and Donald on Main Street. But we waited only a couple of minutes to meet the princesses at the 11am appearance (Cinderella & sofia) and Winnie Eeyore.I guess the downside of going in the off season is the risk of ride closures for maintenance which for us included the castle and one of our favourite rides   Small World   as well as a couple of other attractions.One of the highlights was the Mickey & the Wondrous Book Show. The Fairy Tale Forest was sweet. And the best ride was the Runaway Mine Cars.The parade was quite quick (seemed shorter than usual).Don   t bother with the Disney Railroad."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"555471607,4,2018-1,Philippines,""Don't know if it the weather had anything to do with it (overcast with showers) but my Disneyland experience wasnt as happy and sunny as I expected. The place was terrific, of course: wonderful ambience, castles, great rides for the kids, meet and greets with Star Wars stormtroopers and Chewbacca, plus a parade of Disney stars. Even the food at the cafe was better than expected. I think I was expecting the staff to be a little...warmer. sunnier. Friendlier. I mean, this is Disneyland! Shouldn't they be a little less..brisk? And much more like people working in a place of dreams and magic? But dont get me wrong, they were professional and courteous. Maybe I was just expecting the Disney spirit to be really strong here. Still it was a pleasant experience and I still hope to go back again some time."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"554525329,4,2017-12,Indonesia,""Hong Kong Disneyland is smallest Disneyland in the world. But it doesn't mean unattractive. Several new attraction were added since first time opening. Need walk about 3 minute from parking lot to main entrance. By walking slowly, it doesn't seem so hard.Since I came during high season, Hong Kong Disneyland was crowded by tourist. Moreover, although larger and newer Shanghai Disneyland had opened, popularity can't be diminished in one seconds. When I'm across several popular attraction, long queue can be seen clearly. Merchandise store that not so large invaded by huge amount of tourist.Despite these, the attraction and fabulous parade can forget long queue issue. I'm enjoy so much during that time.I'm glad to see concern and priorities among disabilities. Wheelchair user will get priorities to enter attraction without should wait for a long time. Must be appreciated. My parent chose to lunch at outside Disneyland, considered most of restaurant were pricey.

Should be able to operate much faster and less wait time.Souvenir shop wait at emporium was really long. Had about 11 customers waiting and only 2 cashiers and 1 cashier was checking out 6 bags of goods for a customer.

Iron Man and Grizzly Gulch were both brilliant, whole park is very clean, and you don't need to be a long distance athlete to go all the way round it, it's reasonably compact without feeling that everything is packed too tightly together.

Once we had lunch, the queues were up to an hour for silly rides like DUMBO the elephant (going round in circles??). The fastpass system they have is not for every ride and not the most convenient. It would be great if you could buy a priority pass like in Ocean Park.We did manage to watch the Festival of Light show (basically a 25min condensed version of the Lion King) which I thought was really good. I suppose unless your kids or you yourself are a huge Disney fan, Disneyland will not be much of a big deal.

Which meant we didn't have to wait for any rides the only down side was the parade was an inclement weather parade with characters on a float singing & dancing as it went past only a small version of the full parade. The second day the weather was better we arrived latter & had to wait 10 15 minutes for rides at most we saw the full parade at 3:30 Pm which the kids loved. & continued on rides until the light up the night parade which was spectacular. There were no fireworks over the castle as they were in the middle of som renovation in that area. The MTR is so easy to use & efficient mode of transportation to get there & back.

We got our tickets slightly cheaper on Klook, but we wanted physical tickets as souvenir so we had to do exchange at the ticket booths. Oh, it is so worth it for senior persons to visit Disneyland Hong Kong at HKD100 only! Super envious!Same thing for the meal vouchers. We bought on Klook cheaper compared to buying on site which was HKD235 for the 3 in 1 meal coupons. Absolutely worth it to buy this deal as you get to exchange for set meals of prices HKD120 & above each for lunch & dinner, plus a snack. The Mickey Minnie ice cream will cost you HKD39 & popcorn HKD32 35. You do the math! We never even got to use the HKD5 discount for water coupon, as we got bottled water with the set meals anyways (if you don't take soda, coffee tea add HKD10).All the attractions were great fun and our most recommended would be:1) Mystic Manor (the only one in the world!)2) Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh3) Mickey's Philharmonic4) It's a Small World5) Slinky Dog Spin6) Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (not for the faint hearted!)We covered more than 11 attractions right up to the fireworks at 8.30pm. If u want more time for the rides & to shop, u shud arrive once the park opens. After 4pm, the queues were noticeably shorter. Overall, we didnt have to queue more than 30mins per attraction.As for food, if you have the 3 in 1 meal coupons, just head to Royal Banquet Hall for lunch & Explorer's Club for dinner.

The attractions are set up well and the park flows as you walk round it into the different areas.The food was good, a bit over priced but that was expected with the place you are in.There are parades at set times in the day that are a must watch, these are fun and you get to see all the cast of the movies that are in the show and there is a dance element to it that really blends in with the culture in HK.Only thing that was a let down when we were there was that there was alot of construction going on so a few parts of ths park were missed out so it wasnt great.All in all.

"552763761,4,2018-1,United States,""If you can only spare 1 day to visit and have young kids in tow, this Disneyland couldn't be more perfect. With a footprint much smaller than the Anaheim or Orlando locations, even the furthest more points of the park are no more than a 20 25 minute walk from each other, even with a tired child in tow. We had heard from friends who are Disney enthusiasts that the rides at the HK location had more advanced technology (ergo would be funner) than their much older cousins in Anaheim and Orlando. This was not the case   we discerned no difference between HK and the Orlando location, the latter of which we had visited only 3 years earlier. The smaller scale of the park is best reflected in Main Street (considerably shorter than Orlando) and the diminutive  Magic Castle  (w a much smaller size compared to Orlando) almost made me laugh out loud. In any event, there was plenty to do and despite making use of all three (3) of the park's  fast passes , we literally found ourselves hurrying from ride to ride during our 11am 8pm visit.If you are anywhere within walking distance of an MTR stop, definitely consider taking the train to from Disneyland. From Central or Kowloon, you simply take the orange line to Sunny Bay then transfer to the Disney dedicated shuttle train.Disney's policy prohibits  food and alcohol  and contains considerable restrictions on size of backpacks and strollers. We saw no attempt by Disney security to enforce these restrictions. They did indeed search bags but only the main compartments of backpacks and purses and it appeared solely to confirm there were no large scale weapons. If I had to do over again, I would not hesitate to pack plenty of food and snacks (not surprisingly food at Disney is expensive!) and to bring our child's full size stroller so that he was not as tired fussy towards end of day evening. Disney also has a bag drop office located outside of security so in the unlikely event you encounter an overzealous security guard you can always leave your giant stroller or cooler full of food there. Tips Suggestions  Don't hesitate to bring your own food drinks  Stroller bag size restrictions don't appear to be enforced  If you arrive at opening, start with the rides furthest away from entrance (you'll likely face no line), then work your way back towards the entrance  Both the afternoon evening mainstreet parades are worth seeing, the evening parade includes lots of lots of neon lighting."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"552558433,4,2017-12,Greece,""It   s always so much fun to go to Disney and this time was not an exception. It   s a small park (in comparison to Orlando) but still there were all the great parades, street performances, rides and shows you find at Disney. Prices were a bit    Hong Kong    like but that was expected. There was however problem with the WiFi. That did not help if you wanted to use the app (which usually had wrong queue times). We enjoyed the fact that we could go there with the MTR and it   s a relatively quick ride from HongKong island. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"552111145,5,2017-12,Japan,""We went there 29 30 December 2017, staying in one of the Disney hotel helped a lot because we just took shuttle bus and visit the parks in the morning and comeback and rest in the afternoon before head back for firework and night attraction. Our favorite attractions are Big Grizzly Mountain and Parachute drop, highly recommended. Parades were great as usual, especially Xmas theme related shows. Firework was also second to none. The only point that I kinda dislike was F&B in terms of price, long line to purchase, and taste was just decent. However, you can bring your own food and drink inside as long as you carry them with your backpack.Tips:1. Go there early, and go inside to Toy story zone first so that you can enjoy attractions then walk back up front for other attractions and parades.2. Like other Disneyland, foods and drinks are allowed as long as you can carry in your backpack (luggage with wheels is not allowed) Thus, bring food and drink so that you save some money.3. Use fast pass, when possible and also you should download Disneyland Hong Kong app (very useful because it tells you how long you have to wait for each attraction) 4. Buy Ticket online before go to park so that you can skip ticket line (line was long during our visit)Hope you will have great time here ^ ^"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"551858612,4,2017-12,Australia,""Being a 90s kid, watching the likes of the Lion King, Toy Story, and Tarzan, visiting Disneyland brought me back to the 90s.So much variety, from rides, to food, to merchandise and photos with mini and mickey mouse, Disneyland Hong Kong has something for all ages (But mostly for children). Mad sure to book online prior to arrival, you may enter the park with online QR code tickets (this helped as I didn't have to line up to get tickets. Arrived around 12:30pm, on the Disneyland train which was exciting. Line up to get into the park was short, once I was in, the park was packed. With park entry you are entitled to receive three fast track entries to any ride, you must go to the ride and scan your ticket in the fast track lanes and come back when the ticket advises you too.Made sure I grabbed an English language map then took the train within the park to check out the entirety of the venue which gave me an idea of what was in the park. Visited the Iron man and star wars ride within tomorrow land, the jungle river cruise, the  its a small world after all  ride, and Tarzan's tree house. Took a photo with Minnie and Mickey Mouse (Had to line up for over an hour).Make sure you stay until 9:00 pm for the fireworks at the parks close. Merchandise is expensive just like any other theme park and or zoo. Food is also expensive, but there is variety depending on the area you are in. Tomorrow land had burger and chip meals, near the jungle river cruise their is Asian foods. Throughout the park there is a number of pop up stands which sell ice creams, hot dogs, popcorn, drinks and snacks. I was really surprised with the waiting lines for rides, although it seems at first you may have to wait a while, the lines move quick and if the sign at the ride says a 60 minute wait realistically, for me it was a 35 minute wait which was good. Sadly didn't get to see alot, because there is so much to do, so I recommend getting a two day pass. Try get there an around 10:30am when the park opens, time flys when you are having fun.I had a great experience, Disneyland Hong Kong is a place you must go and visit."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"551746933,5,2017-10,Australia,""The park is separated from the rest of Hong Kong so I recommend staying on site if you can. It is also probably the cheapest Disneyland for both tickets and accommodation.But it   s not lacking in attractions. We visited during Halloween, the Villains night time parade was spectacular, the temporary haunted house was great, but probably for bigger kids.Highlights included the IronMan Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Jedi Training, and Grizzly Gulch. Other attractions are still great, though the long line for the Winnie the Pooh is somewhat weird, I recommend using he fast pass system for that one.Food was good, thankfully, as there are no breakfast other options. We had a quick service at tomorrow land which was filling and great Value at HK$99 for a meal. And a nice meal in the Main Street Restaurant which was pricey HK$660 for two but still very nice.It is warm during the day, but most lines are in the shade or air conditioned except for the smaller rides eg Orbitron and Dumbo. And It   s a small World is always worth the effort.We got a free fast pass for staying at the hotel. Nice perk.English is not everyone   s first language, the cast do a great job communicating though.The cast members are impeccable they take their role seriously, especially in the Jedi training."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The waiting times for rides were nothing less the 50 minutes and that was for the less popular rides. I would hate to be a parent trying to explain this to a child. The food was reasonably priced and transportation to get there easy. I only went to look around, and enjoyed what I saw.

The park is divided in the following areasMain Street USA  Just at the entrance is the Train station which takes you to Fantasy Land. Also the parade happens at the Main Street.

We felt a day was enough as the park is quite small in comparison to anything you get in USA and therefore we walked around at least twice and covered all the rides we wanted twice too. The queues for most rides were under 30 mins without paying for a fast pass.

The rides were great, especially Hyper Space Mountain and all the Star Wars theming of Tommorwland. The food was pretty good. The lack of all the princess stuff was a nice bonus. It was easy to get to from Causeway Bay and the restaurants had plenty of space. We never had to queue more that 15 minutes for any ride (it wasn't a holiday there).

It's clean and there is a cheerful atmosphere.We spent our day taking in the faster rides now that our daughter is tall enough to ride them. The Star Wars HyperSpace Mountain ride is excellent and wait times are minimised with the freely available fastpass tickets.The RC Racer ride in Toy Story land is a basic pirate ship type of swing ride but styled like a radio control car and if anything a little faster, certainly more thrills than a normal pirate ship ride.The Big grizzly Mountain Runaway mine cars ride was closed during the day but opened later in the evening. This was a boon as we were able to ride this attraction 4 times in a row as the rest of the park had gone to the main street for the parade.Tarzan's treehouse is looking a bit tired and frankly dated... time for rethink there I would suggest. That said the adjacent Jungle River cruise was good fun.The Jedi academy in Tomorrowland was also good fun, 11yo getting to train with other Padewan Learners and ultimately go up against Darth Vader and his apprentice.

Only thing which i didn't liked was the cost of food items, ice creams, gift items  souvenirs etc..everything was pretty expensive. After every ride you will end up into a shopping zone where such items were being sold. Avoid taking luggage to the place as they charge a lot to keep the luggage."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The last train was Disneyland's train. We arrived there about 10 am ish & stayed up to about 9pm. We were buggered but it was worth it. We took some of the rides, free train ride, Gold mine ride and Star Wars ride. Had lunch and did some shopping. It wasn't cheap but I thought what the heck, I'm on holiday.

549842579,3,2017-6,Australia,I visited Disney Land Hong Kong last year while on a 2 day trip. Overall it was okay and would be very exciting for kids or someone who had never been to a Disney Land before. I have been to others previously and found Hong Kong to be the smallest of them with only a few real adult rides. Space Mountain was by far the best of these. The evening fireworks were great as always and staff fantastic. Could do the park in half a day if required. We arrived at 11am and had seen it all by 3pm but hung around for the Parade. Lots of queues but not bad by Disney Land standards,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
549835360,5,2017-12,Philippines,The park decoration and events are awesome during the holiday season. We enjoyed the Mickey and Friends Christmastime Ball as well as the night parade.

"549742935,3,2017-12,Russia,""In essence, if you come after 11 am, you will only find a huge ultra loud Disney Hollywood themed upsell heaven, a huge outdoor mall with expensive toys and food, and occasional rides with 45 90 minute wait times. You will also find that some attractions with long queues are just walk through  art  displays or talking cartoon characters   a ridiculous waste of time, if you ask me. So, if it's rides you're after, the main thing is to come early, just when the doors open at 9:30. You will then enjoy all the rides within some 90 minutes and then spend the rest of your time as you please. If you can't, do buy the fast pass, you'll be helpless and very dissatisfied without it. Another worthy option is to book a stay at one of the three hotels around the park: they offer an extra admission hour from 8:30 to 9:30 in the morning plus 1 fast pass on any ride for all guests, and that helps a lot. You don't have to book direct or at HK DL site, booking.com and other aggregators may offer better deals.Prices are another pain point. Dining is quite expensive, either in the park or in hotels. You do want to consider the dining coupons offered on HK DL website, as well as ticket hotel combos and other offers";" they make sense. The offers and prices there and at klook.com are the cheapest (and identical), but at Klook you can collect points and save at other HK attractions (you can save 25 HKD off your first order with code WK7A9 then explore more coupons at picodi.com). Alternatively, do bring your own snacks and drinks.If you can still feel your feet at the end of your DL experience, exit the park and walk right of the whale sculpture. You'll enjoy a beautiful and almost empty (yet also plagued with loud music) passage to the pier and hotel gardens, and a great seaside view. First hotel to your right has a great bush maze, children love it. Afterwards you can exit through the hotel and take a free shuttle bus to the train station."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

I must admit   we didn't know what to expect, but based on the movies   it seemed as a must visit. The place is massive   but definitely more geared towards the family experience and young ones. The rides were fun but not exhilarating. Also expected more of the characters to be visible Entry fee is of course sky high   thus as a value for money attraction   would not recommend.All in all Disneyland has been ticked off the bucket list   but a bittersweet experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We decided to add a trip to Disneyland as part of our journey. And may I say we didn't regret it. The park is smaller than most of the Disney parks but that didn't bother us. As usual the food and drinks are ridiculously priced and in most of the park's food places it's cash only. The day we went the average wait time was about 30 minutes and the weather was perfect. If you visit Hong Kong and you enjoy Disney plan a day trip. You won't regret it.

"549441779,5,2017-12,Singapore,""I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. I have been fortunate enough to visit the non Asian Disney parks (including the tremendous parks in Orlando) and I was expecting the Hong Kong version to be perhaps a bit underwhelming. Not so. It had all the crowd pleasers and some rather unique experiences not found in the other parks. Both my child and the adults accompanying loved our visits.Deserving special mention would be the Mystic Manor and Runaway mine car rides. Mystic Manor was their take on the Haunted Mansions of the other Disney parks. It had minimal ghostly effects though and was all the better for it. It was an enchanting trackless ride in a choreographed group of four ride vehicles through an atmospheric and enchanting set of rooms (depending on which pair of vehicles you take you get a slightly different ride perspective";" my favorite is the front pair). One of the better rides in any Disney park. The runaway mine cars rides is also a very well judged roller coaster ride with three distinct ride segments that will ensure everyone gets something they enjoy. Also enjoyed the Star Wars treatment of the Space Mountain ride.Park staff were friendly, park and toilets clean and food tasty. There are halal options for Muslim guests who should note that the turkey hot dog stand next to the bakery near the entrance is the only such stand in the park that has halal meat. Some restaurants are also halal certified.Really enjoyed my visit and would come again. For first time visitors a two day pass is recommended so that you can experience all the attractions and take your favorite ones twice."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
"549428085,4,2017-12,Singapore,""As in any famous theme park, and add to that the peak Christmas travel season, there are a lot of people everywhere!!! But it does not matter... For major rides, take advantage of the FastPass. I found this very helpful. All staff are graceful and helpful, despite that they had to work extended hours and even if there are really lots of people visiting that day. Very organized and efficient during the parades. Note though that fireworks will no longer be shown after 1 Jan 2018, so lucky me that I made it before that.. to have a magical experience to witness the last few fireworks display."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"549275479,1,2017-12,Australia,""Overall I actually love Disneyland and had a pretty great time. What ruined in for me was no one spoke to me. I've had rheumatoid arthritis since I was two and use a wheelchair and at every attraction bar one or two (shout out to guy at the carousel) every single employee asked my husband if I can walk transfer. After 27 years in a wheelchair I had gotten used to it (which is messed up in itself), but I found that once I had children people realised I could most likely respond. I had my three year old in my lap 90% of the time and my six year old nearby. I was usually chatting to them when the cast would overlook me to speak to my husband.I'm feeling a little less than because of this treatment. No one deserves to feel overlooked and less than.

So were our meal coupons. The park is huge, and i   m glad that they have this train circling the park. It was almost Christmas and it was Sunday so the pack was there. Average 30 50 mins to wait for a ride, but we went for a Fast Pass for the Iron Man Expo, which was awesome.

The lines suck, but they do so everywhere.I had mini heart attacks every time I saw the food snacks prices. I know that's how they earn but everything was just so unnecessarily expensive!

There are only (4) thrill rides in the park. In our opinion the Runaway Mine Train was the best. Think Thunder Mountain but with a few twists. Hyperspace Mountain is a small scale version of Space Mountain and will appeal to fans of that ride in the US. The Iron Man Ride is a simulator and very good. Mystic Manor is a must see! It   s a hyped up and fun version of the Haunted Mansion and the technology and special effects are amazing!There are limited food options through the park compared to US parks but quality is very good.We visited on a Friday and crowds were manageable.

The foods were bland :( The cafes pastries and bread are really good, i ordered this flaky chashiu pastry and ice milktea it was really tasty!The staffs and cast are lovely, helpful and nice, toilets are clean and big, they also have water fountain for u to drink free if u dont mind drinking from tap water.Unfortunately I did not stay for fireworks :    but for my first disney park experience I enjoyed it so much!!One tip for you all the merchandise are ofc overprice(its disney what do u expect) I recommend u to not buy the    foods    items inside the giftshops such as candies, ramen, lollypop, etc, why? Cause they are soooo overprice and you can get ur own disney themed candies foods outside disneyland!!! For example i bought this gummy candy from the park and it cost 65 HKD the. I went to best mart 360 guess what I found same exact candy for 12 HKD!!!! And guess what they have other candies with better taste and packaging with DISNEY LICENCED as well!!!

The atmosphere is fantastic along with all the fun rides and entertainment. My visit was in may and the park was really quiet, the longest we waited for an attraction was about 20 mins! Incredibly short waiting times made experiencing the park a breeze and we were able to go on the rides more than once. The entertainment was incredible, from the parades to the firework show! Getting to the park is super easy with Hong Kings train system, the trains are super efficient, cheap, clean and safe, I stayed in Kowloon east and it took under an hour to get there, taking 2 trains both only about a 10  15 minute journey and then taking the Disneyland train which is an experience in itself.

"546321081,5,2017-12,Hong Kong,""If you   ve never been to a Disneyland this is a good introduction to what Disney has to offer. If you   ve been to Disney in any other country, consider this a miniature, manageable one day version of it. The attention to details are to be admired. A lot of rides and attractions are localised, especially the Ironman Experience (which replaced the Buzz Lightyear ride). Most narration is in English, Cantonese and Putonghua, with some being in Cantonese only (Animation Academy). The Mickey Wonderous Book Show was all in Cantonese except the singing parts. However there are subtitles and it doesn   t really take away from understanding of the the graphics show. The restaurants are nothing special. The quality of food is below par and are overpriced. When we went three of the main restaurants were closed so food choice was limited. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so we had that option instead. I didn   t see any drinking water stations. We went on Saturday and Sunday. We ended up not needing the fast pass. Lines were 30 mins max. The lines which were 50mins plus we skipped until later in the evening. If you get to the park as soon as it opens, you can fit in most of the rides before noon. Late afternoon was when it got crazy busy. The evening parade was spectacular. Very impressive. The fireworks were impressive as they are much lower than most firework displays so it was extremely bright. The accompanying music was what made it extra special. And the fake snow comes on right after which was fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"546099512,5,2017-11,Singapore,""Visited Disneyland for a couple of days and the Christmas decoration and programs were very nice. The crowd wasn't too bad and we could easily find seats during dining.

You can walk the main street up to the Christmas trees all day without a single Photographer."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"546098363,4,2017-12,United States,""If you like California Disneyland you   ll love Hong Kong Disneyland with its similar compact size. The park is laid out in the same pattern as its California counterpart   pass through Sleeping Beauty   s castle to enter Fantasyland, turn right for Tomorrowland, etc. Of course, there are key differences that make this park special, including hearing instructions in Cantonese before English, watching mainly Chinese cast members perform, and dining at restaurants featuring a variety of Chinese and Japanese items along with American hamburgers. It is at once a fun and cultural experience.My two favorite rides were The Iron Man Experience, a motion simulator movie ride that has Iron Man saving downtown Hong Kong Island, and Mystic Manor, a high tech reimagining of The Haunted Mansion. But no ghosts appear in this through the dark ride. Instead it retells the weird stories of explorer Lord Henry Mystic and his too curious pet monkey Albert. There are surprises funny and scary at every turn.The stage performances are top quality, including    Festival of the Lion King    with special effects, choreography, and singing on par with    The Lion King    on Broadway. My only letdown was the Iron Man Showcase when the hostess began by announcing    Our presentation will be Cantonese    and began to explain the various projects without one word of English. I was completely lost. Fortunately when Iron Man spoke, his words were only English. (Did this confuse the largely Chinese crowd?) A day   s visit here is worth the time, and you probably can do everything in one day if you come when the park opens and play all day, enjoying lunch and dinner on site."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The night time parade (Light the Night) has characters from Monsters Inc, Lilo & Stitch and Cars as well as Mickey, Donald, etc. I recommend getting the Photo pass as the photographers take plenty of photos and also do the  magic shots  with characters added to your photos. There are plenty of food places for lunch and dinner. Stay for the fireworks at 8.30pm.

The rides here have a smaller height requirement and most of the rides can be done by kids.. Over the day the park sure gets crowded although we went on a weekday to beat the crowd.. I recommend that study the park before you go.. and identify the rides you want to take FOR SURE types so that you get to them ASAP and avoid long queues.For example by the end of the day the Carousel queues were really long and we skipped that.. You can consider getting fast pass too.. (we didnt).DONT MISS the Disney parade that happens at 3PM or the time they keep announcing.. And the highlight for us was the night parade.. This was the first time we were seeing it (don   t remember seeing it in Paris or US) and we were floored with it.. Its something you GOT TO WATCH to see the    Magic   .Found it better than the fireworks too..

Having visited WDW Orlando and Disneyland Anaheim our expectations were pretty high and you exceeded those expectations. The entry process was quick and easy and the staff were very friendly. Download the app before you go so you can study the map and attractions etc. this also gives you the wait times for the attractions and you can also purchase your tickets from here. The lines for the rides were minimal and the most we had to wait was 20 minutes at one stage of the day. A few of the rides and attractions we had seen before and thought it wouldn   t hurt to skip them, but having to wait less in queues meant that we could enjoy all the attractions. I   m glad we had time for this as almost every ride at HK Disneyland is different than the other parks in the USA.    Disney paint the night    was absolutely fantastic, a great addition to the nighttime entertainment. Food was a little over priced as always with any theme park but we found plenty on offer.

The halt of all outdoor rides had caused all visitors to pack into the indoor ones. Looking at almost all indoor rides having a very long line, I started to feel down. Most of the food outlets were closed. After walking around for some time, finally we came across one. We tried the food (fried rice), but the taste was just far from yummy. At 4 p.m., all visitors were told to leave the park as it was thought that the weather would get worse. The visitors that day were given a free entry to the park within one year for free. However, since I was in Hong Kong for a one week vacation, I could never come back there. I realize weather is beyond control";" however, given the ticket price I paid, what I got in it (I didn't get a lot) was not worth it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
"544327614,3,2017-11,Australia,""We went on a rainy day in November. Despite this, it was still super busy! My 4 year old was a bit hesitant to go on some rides.

The entry is expensive, but we felt it was an experience we wanted to give our kids. The Disneyland themed train is fun too!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"544141605,4,2017-11,Singapore,""We have just returned from Hong Kong and have spent 2 days in Disneyland. November is a great time to visit, the weather is cool and it does not coincide with any China or Hong Kong holidays so the park is not crowded.Our plan was to complete as many rides on the first day and then we look at taking pictures.We had skipped all photo taking opportunities with Disney Characters and headed straight for the Ironman experience. It took us 15 20 mins to get on the rides.The ride was great, and all my kids aged 11, 9 and 5 loved it.It definitely pays to stay in one of the Disney hotels as it allows you access to priority queue to enter Disneyland.After completing the rides in Tomorrowland, we moved on to Fantasyland where we had our lunch at the Royal Banquet hall. Dining within Disneyland is pricey and not worth the value but Royal Banquet hall is one of the best places to eat.After lunch we headed to Grizzly Gulch where the Big Mountain ride was what we feel the best ride of the day. it was a 30min queue but this is peanuts compared to the queues we had at Japan Disneyland.We moved on to Mystic Point where the only attraction worth mentioning is the Mystic Manor. The ride is interesting with a tinge of scary feel to it (it was enough to spook my 9 year old..in a good way) and created a bit of excitement to weary bodies late in the day.After dinner at the Bakery (as most places had long queues for dinner) we lounged around main street to snap photos of the neon lit buildings. We made our way to the center garden and waited for the Parade to start. It was more magical lights with our favourite characters. It was awesome to see Lightning McQueen and Mack and the other Disney characters such as Toy Story Characters, Belle and beast.Fireworks came after the parade and the whole main street was filled with artificial snow since its 1 month away from Christmas. The lights on the Main Street buildings were mesmerizing.We went back on Day 2 and joined the queue to have a snap with Mickey and Minnie. They were great and duly obliged with hugs and were patient but the queue took more than an hour. I have the luxury of my Mrs in the queue while I took the boys to wander the Main Street attractions such as riding on the Taxicab. They would not have stood well in the queue. If you have only one day in Disney I suggest you skip this.We explored Adventure land after lunch and went up Tarzan's tree house and went on the Jungle River Cruise.The one show you shouldn't miss is the Festival of the Lion King in Adventure land. The performance is awesome and its not easy to keep my 5 year old engrossed in something that is not animated. We went back for 2nd rounds on some of our favourite rides such as Big Mountain, Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience.We found some food trucks that serve packaged local fare outside Disneyland that is really affordable so that is where we ate for dinner on the 2nd day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

However the 4D effect is slightly worse off than those in USS, not a adrenaline pumping. The rest, more suitable for younger kids.

People are also quite rude, had a couple incidents of grown adults running past us (with a 3 and 5 year old) pushing us to get to a ride. Not Disney's fault of course but doesn't lend to a pleasant experience. Also the train ride to the park is very long and quite crowded even in the Disney only designated train   I think they should consider running more trains.

"541903961,5,2017-10,United States,""Our family (3 Adult) with our 4 year old went for two wonderful days (US$303 4pax 2day). It was less expensive for us than Ocean Park due to the huge promo. The park was empty except after 4pm which made it difficult to see the evening Halloween Parade. Disney has free water & free seating all over the park for a great comfortable day. The very long Disney rides have moving seats so you can rest while enjoying the adventure. They also have great sit down shows where you also rest. At other amusement parks you stand all day for rides seconds long. There are so many wonderful adventures here at this park. It is great for parents because you are not forced to go on bone crushing rides, because they have imagination rides instead. The Lion King Show was the best, my 4 year old loved the Iron Man simulator though it was a little rough for my wife & It's Small World is a family Fun Boat Ride. The Jedi training for only very small children was a great treat for me & my wife. They hired really quality actors to play in this realistic training of a Jedi Knight. The kids believe they are doing it. The mine ride roller coaster is great without knocking your teeth out. The Mystic Manner was my favorite ride of a spooky house of a rich antique collector, though my son was hiding under the ride chair. You take 100's of photos everywhere you turn. This park is so beautiful and so clean (except the dinning area). Donald Duck 4D movie (spitting water) was good after second view, my son could not pick up the concept the first time around. Meeting Mickey Mouse on Main Street (@930am before the gates open at 10am) in all his royalty was a highlight. The early parade is better because the crowds have not arrived yet.The night time fire works show is one of the best in the world. The Chinese government had the biggest fireworks show in maybe the world the day before we went to Disneyland, so Disney kind of switched there show to a multi media fireworks lights sound themed show which made it very unique.Even with the empty park, there were no empty tables to eat food at in there dining rooms (this is something they need to fix).You will have a very long day at Disney because no one leave until after the wonderful night time fireworks show. There is a 730pm night parade than 9pm fireworks.

We spent a half day which was more than enough to ride everything and see the sites.

And who doesn't love the fireworks display!The rides are amazing and it caters for all.Kudos to be given to all staffs in Disneyland Hong Kong! I cannot imagine how the staffs handled the teeming excited crowds of people everyday.

The softcopy file will also given to you by their apps. Tips:  buy their tickets online include meal. They have a package of 4. it's cheaper buying online than buying on the spot.

"540541047,3,2017-11,Australia,""Hong Kong Disney is a small scale Disneyland for anyone who has been to the LA or Florida versions. Plenty to do for young kids (up to age 7 8 yrs), but for older kids or adults, you will get bored quickly. Only 3 4 good rides for this one   Hyperspace Mountain (faster and more impressive than its cousin Space Mountain), Grizzley Gulch railroad ride (again faster and more variation than Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in LA), Ironman ride (comparable to Space Tours in LA) and the Mystic Manor (  Haunted House in LA). We went for the day but were done by around 3.30pm. Good for a stop over visit if you have some time to kill on a layover from the airport (it is very nearby), but expensive ($587 HK   1 day)unless you have young kids to get value for money."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Maxim   s has a restaurant here for a good grub before heading home.The Mickey Mouse waffles on Main Street was great.The meet and greet were very popular but maddening as the queues snaked out of view.Electric parade was not too impressive.Fireworks and light and sound show was lovely.Shops were nicely laid out and not too overwhelming, thankfully."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We stayed until mid afternoon, there were 2 parades during that time, both were good with a lot of sing and dancing. Heaps of souvenir shops line the main walk way.

Food and beverage was limited, long queues to take photos with the main characters, kept on changing them without any notice, limited rides, mainly for kids so Disney saying for all ages is just not correct.

Keep it good work!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"539863613,5,2017-10,United States,""Thanks to HK's efficient MTR system, this place is very easy to reach. Go there at least 45 minutes before opening because by opening time, there's already a huge build up of people waiting for the  flood gates  to open. And when they do, people run toward the most popular rides to try to beat each other out of the line. Our first ride was the Iron Man Experience   careful, lots of motion in this 3D theater but fun. If you can, plan for a two day visit to make the most of the park especially if you have kids in tow. My favorite experience was  The Lion King Show . Don't miss this for anything else there. Also, if you can purchase food vouchers inclusive of your tickets, do so. I did two meals and a snack   for each of my family members and I'm glad I did because we planned and did stay there from start to finish. This was a better way to save money than having to purchase individual meals there.That said, for next time, we would just buy one meal (preferably dinner that is redeemable after 4:30 PM) and a snack (a choice of popcorn or ice cream stick anytime) for each person and just eat a heavy breakfast before leaving home or hotel. My favorite meal was the  Singapore Laksa Noodle Soup  at the Tahitian Terrace (you can redeem vouchers at other restaurants as well). The Indian Tandoori Chicken meal was  blah .As for the fireworks display, try to position yourself somewhere in the Rotunda of the Main Street to have the best view of the fireworks when they conclude the day. If you have kids (or you're a kid at heart) ask the attendants for stickers, even the janitors themselves happily give them out for collecting. And, bring a water bottle. Drinking fountains are a bit scarce there (there's one by the Iron Man Experience) out that's the way to stay hydrated and saving money at the same time. If you're used to Disneyland in California and Florida, don't expect the cast to be as friendly. They are, just not U.S. Disney friendly. At least that's my personal opinion. Enjoy!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was incredible! The singing, the dancing was 6 stars !The 3pm parade and the paint the night parade at 630pm were awesome! The energy from all the performers was infectious! They looked you in the eye as they past, they waved and high fived my kids, tinker bell blew kisses to my son and made him feel so special as did the Dances in the jumping Tigger costumes. They were so talented.The park was spotless as were every toilet I went to and every eating area. Even the lady taking our order at the Comet diner was so friendly and talking to my kids and I in English. Food was good to!Every part of my 3 days here was amazing.

"539614263,3,2016-12,Hong Kong,""If you are wondering whether or not to spend a day at Disney Hong Kong, it all comes down to for you are looking for.  How much do you like thrill rides?Disney HK is quite tame on that regards, with Grizzly Gulch and Space Mountain being the most ''extreme'' rides, the latter being already a slower version of the attraction.   What's the age group?Due to the above comment, a younger audience might be more appreciative.A high energy group looking for some round the clock fun would probably be disappointed by Disney HK.   Would you go mainly for the rides or for soaking up the  Disney feel ?As it's been pointed out by many reviewers, the number of attractions isn't huge and many are not rides. Some visitors come to mainly walk around and enjoy the scene. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a day packed with numerous attractions and thrill rides, HK Disney won't probably cut it and Ocean Park might be a better option."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"539556247,5,2017-11,Hong Kong,""Originally we were unsure about taking our toddler to Disneyland, but after reading a few blogs advice we decided to give it a go. We had a great day!  The park is a lot smaller than the original Disney in California, which I saw as an advantage. It's flat so easy with a stroller (although we only took our carrier). We caught the train, which takes you straight to the entrance. I was surprised by the number of rides we were able to take our toddler on, Fantasyland was a particularly good for this. I'll list them below:FantastylandDumbo the Flying Elephant   simple up and down ride that she loved. We had to ride separately (only 2 per carriage).It's a Small World   a little nervous about the dark initially, but loved the music and charactersCinderella's Carousel   horses are quite high up making it difficult to stand next to the toddler if you sit them on a horse. We had a carrier which made it easier, I just hopped on and she was happy to hold the pole.Mad hatter's Tea Cups   closed for maintenance :( but easy to ride with a toddlerThe Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   got a bit scary in parts (darkness thunder lightening)Fairy Tale Forest   Loved wandering around this, she happily bopped away to the music. Mickey's Philharmagic   she sat on my knee and bopped away. Did get a little loud and dark at timesTomorrowland Orbitron   very simular to Dumbo ride but in spaceshipsNothing else was suitable for toddlers ToyStory Playland Slinky Dog Zig Zag Spin   Simular to Dumbo and Orbitron but a bit fasterAdventureland We didn't make it here but the Jungle Cruise and Tarzan's Treehouse could be doable with a toddler. Theatre in the Wild   Loved the Lion King Show!!! Highly recommended!We didn't stay for the parade as our toddler was so tired. There are 2 parades   3pm and 6.30pm. Fireworks at 7.30. The food was ok, but i recommend bring snacks for the toddler (you're not supposed to bring food into the park, but as long as you're not packing a picnic they seem to overlook it).We went on a Tuesday and got there as soon as it opened (10.30am) so the park wasn't crowded and the lines for the rides were 5 10 minutes maximum. Discount park tickets and food vouchers are available through Klook and simple to redeem. We just went straight to the turnstile when we arrived.

Our longest wait was to visit with Cinderella who could not have been more gracious and kind to our kiddos. She had to be melting under her gown, wig, and makeup but she took great care to give each guest her undivided attention. All of the live shows were excellent entertainment! The Lion King was quite wonderful. We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel so we were able to break up our day, rest a bit, and return in the evening for uncrowded rides and a spectacular fireworks show.

"538740219,5,2017-9,India,""We were allotted just a day for Disneyland, located on Lantau Island, in our package tour, and I knew it would not be enough from experience. ( I had been to Disneyworld in Florida and in three full consecutive days I had not been able to see all of it. ) We were awestruck by the beauty, the colourful displays and the cleanliness when we entered the Magical Fantasy Land ! We tried to work out a schedule according to the times and places where shows would be held, as detailed in the free brochure, but soon had to give it up since running from one location to another to keep up with the timings in the vast place was well nigh impossible. Trying another more practical approach, we started exploring with the help of a guide map also provided free. Still, in each attraction we could see only one or two parts before moving on, lest we miss out on many more.Being Sunday, there was a special parade from 3 to 4 and again from 7 to 8 p.m. We could enjoy a boat ride through a  jungle  with mechanised, very realistic animals, had lunch at The Explorer's Club ( there were country   region wise food areas,which sold mostly fast food and also some ethnic dishes ), saw many fairy characters and read a few pages of stories from books displayed on pedestals. We could visit or see stalls of Spider Man, Iron Man and Merman, had a tram ride and also saw The Toy Story. In the evening we enjoyed a song and dance programme in the auditorium before returning to Main Street to watch the display of fireworks at the end of the day. The entrance ticket included all rides and attractions and we did not have to pay anything more except for food and drink and souvenirs of which there was a plethora to choose from at various sales points. Some staff members gave away stickers with pictures of characters and attractions..We boarded our coach to return to the hotel, thrilled, tired, but yearning for more. SPECIAL MENTION : It had become very hot during the day. One of our group members was on a wheel chair and one of the rubber tyres became loose due to the heat. We tried to fix it back, but in vain. We were so grateful to a strong well built Philipino gentleman who helped us get back on track.At the auditorium, the differently abled person was given priority and accommodated in a vantage position along with her escort.RECOMMENDATIONS : 1. Plan for at least two full days to spend at Disneyland to be able to enjoy yourselves at leisure   more if you have young children, who would enjoy rides of which there are many. You have to queue up in many places for which some time should be allowed.2. Carry your own drinking water   it is exorbitantly priced inside !"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"538734390,4,2017-11,Ireland,""Compared to US or European Disney parks this one is a steal at roughly    30 per person per day, food is reasonably prices considering you are a totally captive audience at around    15    20 for main courses. Highlights of Space Mountain, Toy Story parachutes and Mystic Manor went down a total storm with our kids as did the Lion King and 3d cinema. What nearly proved to be a disaster was accidentally locating the Elsa character greeting, completely hidden and that was what our daughter had been going to the park to find and went down less well was the one hour and 20 minute wait to get access to the Minnie and Mickey character greeting, a second set of characters elsewhere on park would resolve that for very little cost.

"537994836,5,2017-10,United States,""My husband and I scheduled a trip to HK with no prior plans set. When he suggested going to Disney I was so excited! I have never been to Disney so this was a chance to check that off my bucket list. We preordered tickets through an app for a small discount. This allowed us to go in without queue (which seemed short anyway). It was the weekend prior to Halloween so the parade was villain themed (7pm). You'll want to get there early for a good seat. At 8pm there are fireworks over the castle, so stick around. We mostly went for the rides so I can't really comment on the characters as previous people have. We did enjoy the rides and this time of year the queues are quite short. I think 30mins was our longest queue but most were only 5 10mins. I recommend sticking around after the parade and riding a few more rides. Don't leave right then as half the park does, so transportation must be hell then. We left 40mins later and it was a breeze (ps  ride the runaway cars in the dark!) I also recommend downloading the HK Disney app. It gives you a map and the wait time of all rides in real time. Food: We did eat burgers at the park. While expensive I would say it was average price for an amusement park. Both ours were tasty. We also got popcorn for the parade and that was really good!

"537868290,3,2017-11,Australia,""I went to Disneyland to ride in the Teacups, but they were undergoing renovation   so the sign said. Many of the restaurants were closed. The Fantasy Garden where you can usually have photos taken with all the characters was also closed. The sign said Mickey and Friends would be at The Main Street entrance for photos. Later in the day when we tried to join the line at the Main Street entrance for photos with Mickey we were told that there were enough people already so we were turned away. The line was not extensive or long by an means. The Omnibus Street vehicle was out of service. When we went to Disney's Storybook Theatre to see the 4.30 Mickey Show there was an employee holding a sign saying this show is full. I think that if you are paying $100AUD you should expect that EVERY attraction would be open and operational.A tip   buy your ticket online from the Disneyland website. You will not have to line up at the ticket booth and you will save some time. If you are a visitor to Hong Kong you will also receive a $50HK shopping voucher."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also tickets for adults were only around another $10 to book the extra day and less for Seniors. This worked well for our group. Some queuing but wasn't too long but would not go on a public holiday or special event day. Check their calendar online. Lots of teens there but plenty of rides and attractions geared towards younger children as well..which suited us. Worth catching the parade. Too long a queue for Mickey and Minnie to have photos but the children did get to meet a couple of Princesses. Would recommend pre booking tickets."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"537558495,4,2017-11,Sweden,""Having visited both the Disney parks in both Orlando and Los Angeles I would judge this one as on the smaller side. Apart from that it's a Disneyland with all the magic you would expect.Extra marks for the train that immerses you into the Disney magic even before you arrive.A few things that we noted that could be better though:* On our visit several restaurants were closed. We had to search quite long for restaurants that were not waaay to expensive. In my mind, eating at a Disney park doesn't have the purpose of eating high class food, it's just about filling up energy quickly to get back into the park. If you need to close restaurants, please keep more of the lower priced ones open.* A little too much Chinese for an international park. For example, our 4 year old attended the Jedi academy and it was spoken a lot in chinese. Now, he doesn't understand English either, but if it was in English we could have helped him better. Perhaps more separate events in Chinese and English?* Opening hours 10:30 to 20:00 is too short. I don't know why they chose to open so late and close so early, but isn't most Disney parks in the US open until about midnight?"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I went on a weekday and almost all the rides had a waiting time of less than 5minutes. 2. Was disappointed to discover that the Buzz Lightyear ride was decommissioned. However, my absolute favorite is still Mystic Manor. 3. Food is expensive, but still reasonable. 4. There are water fountains at some designated spots, so you can fill your bottles there. 5. This was my second time visiting Disneyland HK, so 1 day is enough. Highly recommend first timer to get the 2 days pass so you can enjoy the park at a leisurely pace. 6.

"537139313,3,2017-10,Philippines,""My 4 grandchildren who had no experience of the LA and Orlando Disney had relative fun spending a whole day in the HK Disney. They .spent most of their time in the rides since Disney characters were wanting to seek autographs from and pose for pictures. They were only able to get Mickey and Minnie's autographs and pictures after a sweltering 2 hour queue, Chip and Dale and a picture with Goofy who luckily was roaming the Main Street. As a Halloween treat, there were two (2) short parades added: Mickey's Halloween Time Street Party and Villains Night Out! Chapter Two. However, these couldn't compare with the pomp and glamour in the parades at LA, more so at Orlando. The place was small, the rides and the fireworks even, leave much to be desired too. At any rate, since my grandchildren did not have anything to compare their experience with, they were moderately contented, clamoring for more rides hopefully in the future."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"537126079,3,2017-10,Vietnam,""It was school holidays, my brother lives in Hong Kong, and I had a 9 year old that wanted to go to DisneyLand.We had a couple of days visiting my brother, and then 2 days at the Park, overnighting at the Disney Explorer's Lodge. One advantage of the Lodge is that they have a shuttle bus to and from the Park, running every 15 minutes or so. That saved time (and money) getting to and from the Park.Firstly, I was surprised at how small Disneyland was, especially compared with what I remembered of my first (and last) visit to Disneyland in Anaheim in 1985! After getting through the turnstyles, we jumped on the Disneyland train that took us around the perimeter and deposited us at the back end of Fantasyland. It was quite quiet (we arrived around 2pm) and access to the rides was not lengthy. We jumped on Dumbo, which was suitable for small kids, and then went to Mickey's Phiharmajic. That was really great, a 3D movie themed around the Mickey Mouse song, played by an animated orchestra. Featuring Donald Duck (not Trump) as the conductor. At the end of the performance Donald went flying through the air and ended up going through the back wall!We wandered across to the Mad Hatter Tea Cup and spun ourselves silly, and then had a rest and an ice cream. We caught up with some friends around 4pm, and went straight to the Iron Man show. This one was a 4D movie, and was well worth the entry fee. We were in a type of flying fighting machine, which rocked and rolled, and was based in Stark Tower, nominally in Hong Kong. A great way of seeing the skyline, being destroyed by some  bad guys . We then wandered off to Adventureland, which was the highlight, especially the Grizzly Gulch roller coaster. Can't give too much away because I don't want to spoil the fun for others, but it was great. Dusk was falling, which added to the ambience when we went on the Jungle River Cruise. Fake crocs, elephants, hippos, and natives made a lot of noise, and it was quite eery.We ended the day with dinner in the Corner Cafe, where our little girls had some spaghetti, and the men had a pair of Rueben sandwiches. Surprisingly good. Which brings me to the disappointing part of Disneyland. As said at the start, as a themed, fun park, carrying the Disney name, I would have thought it would be better. However, the main emphasis seems to be selling: average and expensive food, and poor quality Disney products. Clothes, dolls, stuffed animals, and other Disney memorabilia. It became a bit much where around every corner there was a food shop, or a retail store. In fact Main Street had one side of it filled with retail. I was fortunate that my daughter was well disciplined, and we only ended up was an umbrella, and a Mickey Spatula, to assist with her baking! Not so lucky were a lot of other parents who were weighed down with lots of  stuff .Overall, the theme park was good, and the nightly fireworks were great. However, it all paled into insignificance compared to the retail and the food."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"536779003,4,2017-10,Canada,""We visited on a Saturday at around 130pm and stayed till 10pm. Buy tickets ahead of time to skip the ticket line. It was busy as expected and line for rides were at least 40 minutes. Food and drinks were expensive like any theme park ($28 32 HKD for bottled drinks and $30ish HKD for corn hot dog ice cream, etc). Snacks stalls do shut down in the evening. There are restaurants that remains open. Evening is the best, as the temperature is cooler and after 6pm or so, we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to as the wait times were anywhere from 0 to 20 minutes, except the night time stuff and kids rides in Fantasyland   lots of kids even at night! The rafts to the treehouse closes in the evening, but do go around 5 6pm to avoid standing in line. Part of Toy Story Land was also blocked off when we got there around 7pm ish. We saw fireworks at 8pm and parade at around 9pm. I've only been to Disney World in Florida. So, in comparison, this Disneyland is much more manageable as a day half day trip.

"536763852,3,2017-8,India,""Ever since we visited the park in Los Angeles, my daughter was keen to visit the one again and we decided to take her to Hong Kong. We were extremely enthusiastic about this place and bought 2 days ticket but we couldnt even spend one full day here. This place is nowhere close to the one in US and is extremely commercial. What I mean by commercial is that the focus is more on shops rather than characters and their house, the disney experience etc. The entrance is designed similar to the one in Los Angeles. There are some rides but those are not the one that one goes to disneyland for. There is a toy train that gives a good ride across the park. However, if you are expecting to meet all the characters then you would surely be disappointed as there are only mickey and mini and they also stand in a shaded area rather than having a home of their own. Plus there arent other characters and princess castle etc. There is a food court and some eateries inside and you can also buy waterbottles etc. so dont worry about carrying food, drinks etc. In summary, what you get is all the toys  figurines etc but the place fails to offer the disney experience. Maybe Disney undermined the tourism potential of Asia and developed a very small park that focuses more on shops rather than Disney experience. After some time it felt as if we are in Disney mall rather than Disneyland. If you havent been to any disneyland then its a fine place to go to. However, if you want a real disney experience, I would suggest visiting the one the Los Angeles (if and when you plan a trip to US). You can separately view my review of the the Disneyland in US.Overall, I was indeed disappointed and its possible that this disappointment was because of my prior visit to the one in US. If you plan to visit, please do keep maximum of a day for it and do carry umbrellas (as it gets really hot in summer) and a camera."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"536732213,4,2017-10,Australia,""Our recent trip to Hong Kong was another testing the user friendly nature of holiday destinations for people in wheelchairs. And, I am pleased to say that Disneyland Hong Kong really did step up to the mark. On entry the staff (cast members they call themselves) pay attention to those in wheelchairs to make it easier to enter. Security and bag checks on entry provide a higher sense of safety in these troubled times. And, don't forget that when you go through the gate ask for the multiple entry stamp so that if you leave during the day you can come back again on the same day without the cost of another ticket. Also if you decide to come back for a second day it is cheaper to upgrade your one day pass to a two or multi day pass at the gate than to buy another ticket. Like all theme parks Disney land is not cheap, food is of poor quality and very expensive, drinks including bottled water are also very expensive. However, they do have rides that cater for people in wheelchairs. In all our travels we have not experienced this before. The park has a number of rides that have special carriages that allow the wheelchair to be loaded passenger and all onto the ride thus ensuring the whole family can enjoy the ride together. These rides are clearly marked on the theme park maps. Other good things about the park include abundant seating as there is a lot of walking to do and a lot of waiting for the young adults (Children) who are off on the roller coasters, etc. when mum and dad are worn out. The paths are easy to navigate even with the crowds and make the use of wheelchairs both manual and electric much easier. We went during the day and then came back at night to watch the fireworks. A tip here   they turn the lights out at night for the fireworks show which in the crush of people makes this a pick pockets paradise. Keep your valuables secure and wear your bag at the front. I had my back pockets touched a number of times during the show but fortunately had my RFID wallet in my front pocket on a chain secured to my belt. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and recommend the park as a good day out for the family. If you stay at one of the Disney resorts they are only a short shuttle bus ride or 15minute walk from the park. We stayed at the Disney Explorers Lodge which already has hundreds of reviews on trip advisor so I will not repeat them here."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

So do plan how you want to use this facility. Bring your own water bottle to refill water.

They don't have the delicious and famous turkey legs!! In October several restaurants were closed. Something that was really shocking for Disney was people who work there did not speak English or spoke English very limited. Really a shame, In Paris, and the USA most of them are bilingual. Here you have one tip, if you are going to buy your tickets on line buy them with the 3 meal plan, you would pay 30 US dollars per person more but just one main dish for lunch is 20 US dollars, ( and you would get a snack, lunch( main dish plus soda) dinner (main dish with soda) and a discount for a beverage) so it definitely is worth it.

HongKong Disneyland however, was entirely the opposite. I really didn   t expect majority of their staff to be grumpy, snobbish, super rude even. Majority don   t smile, they don   t greet, they are not willing to help you out even when asking for a simple direction, they shout, my 4 year old son even got scolded in front of me since he was holding on to one of the queue ropes, the worst part?  I was carrying my son because he got tired while waiting for the queue at the ironman ride, this young staff shouted at me and asked me to put him down! I wanted to argue but I don   t want to ruin our mood so we just complied. In the royal banquet restaurant, the staff are also hot tempered. We hardly understand their english, so we politely requested to repeat what they are saying, but as expected, the staff got pissed and shouted again.When asking for direction, they seemed to be not in the mood to assist as well.In the merchandise stores, don   t expect them to help you when you are buying a US$60 toy and (after paying) you want to try if the battery operated toy is working. I have been told that    it should work or just bring it back it if doesn   t   . The positive side: The park is clean, and there   s always an english translation in almost all the rides. Also, since we went there on a weekday (Monday & Tuesday, which I think is the best time to visit), there was hardly a queue on majority of the rides and attraction . The longest queue is around 20 minutes, while majority is 5 10 minutes thereabouts.I am not sure if our experience with their staff is culture related, but majority of the staff at Disney Hollywood Hotel, including the shuttle bus drivers were likewise rude. I will be sharing our experience at this hotel in a separate review.All in all, if you are used to the friendly ambiance in most Disneyland Resorts, you basically have to lower down your expectations when visiting Hongkong Disneyland.

We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day. We choose to ride our favorite rides 2 3 times and we still rode 80% of the rides at the park.Cast Members   I can't even believe I'm saying this about a Disney property, but the Cast Members were lacking...by a lot! Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more. It seemed accepted and even the cast members looked the other way (figuratively   because most were looking right at them and didn't do a thing). Again, this really took away from the experience. Nothing about the atmosphere at HK Disney seemed  Disney esque There are other minor items on both sides, but these are the major points of interest. Having been to 9 Disney parks around the world, this would definitely be at the bottom of the list.That being said, if you want to go and ride some terrific rides at a park that is not terribly crowded most of the time, then I would encourage you to go. Quite honestly, the little kids probably won't even notice. But the adults, they will notice that this park does not have the Disney mystique."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"535322332,5,2017-10,Malaysia,""What can I say? Its Disneyland! If you have not been to one, this might be THE ONE for you. Its probably the most affordable one.Its great fun, everyone smiles inside, the rides are fun, 3D 4D movies are WOW. Dont miss the end of day parade at 0700pm and the fireworks at 0800pm! Disney sure knows how to put on a show.Whether you are going alone, with your love, or as a family, this place has something for everyone."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"535261523,5,2017-2,Canada,""I believe this is the smallest Disneyland in the world. However it has everything that are offered in other Disneyland. It's better to visit during non holiday weekdays.

535225426,5,2017-10,Australia,My husband and I did a day trip to Disneyland on a Saturday. The park was absolutely incredible and not too busy! Wait times were very reasonable for rides. We were told that the park is quieter at this time of year as school holidays have ended. The variety and price of food was great. You must try a Mickey Waffle they are delicious! I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the park and amenities there was not a spot of rubbish. I would definitely visit again. Price and availability of souvenirs also excellent.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"534787715,3,2017-5,Australia,""We love Disney parks but this one lacks so much appeal compared to USA parks. There is no atmosphere in the park, in parts it was like a deserted ghost town. It is smaller compared to the others which is not a problem but its just lacking in so many ways. The staff are not as friendly either.Some good rides there like your usual space mountain, buzz lightyear etc. Food and drinks are really expensive so be prepared. As a family we never had to really que for anything which was great. Sadly we did not see the parade as a huge storm came over the park. This did not detract from our day as we have seen parades before. Can't quite put my finger on it but we all agreed the park was missing the Disney sparkle."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
534237045,4,2017-10,United States,Hong Disneyland is a must if you are traveling to the area with children or if you're just a Disney fanatic.

The choice of food at restaurants is average but do try the mickey waffle with cream in his ears!!The worst bit for us was character meeting where the staff believe they are entitled to talk and behave with customers the way they like. We had first hand account of a couple begging to meet a character but they were turned down even though they'd come from abroad since they were five minutes late. We ourselves wanted to take our children to meet Donald but were slightly late since my wife stopped to help an elderly couple. I totally understand that being late is not an excuse and am not even arguing about it but the way the lady behaved and talked to us is at best appalling. We don't speak Chinese and she then started joking about us with other customers and they were all laughing. My family was very upset at this so I went to the guest relations team to lodge a formal complaint. The guy there took details of the incident on a small piece of paper and did not ask for my name contact. When I asked how they would send me feedback he said they don't but that he would raise it with the department of the employee concerned."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

532829037,4,2017-10,Sweden,Being middle aged without any kids I probably am the wrong person to rate this since it is a fantasy land for kids. But there are still quite a few things for us adults as well. I liked the Star Wars themed Hyperspace Mountain is a really fast and cramped rollercoaster. Since it all is so fast I didn   t really get the Star Wars feeling I wanted. I really liked the Iron Man Experience. And the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars was a great rollercoaster. But what I really loved was the Mystic Manor. A great little thing that really draws you into the story. We went on the Monday after the Golden Week and didn   t need to use any of our Fast Passes. Great! We didn   t have a problem doing everything we wanted in a day.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"532749781,4,2017-9,Australia,""I visited here on 22.9.17 and loved it. It is very easy to get to by train and then just a short walk from the Disney station to the entrance. For seniors it is one of the best values in town HK$100 (which includes all rides and attraction) so make sure you have something to prove your age. The whole place is Disney    immaculate    and there are many rides and attractions and many many shop! At this stage of life, I forego the more adventurous rides and was more than satisfied with the    It   s a small world    wonderful    river cave    type boat ride gliding past animated representations of children from all over the world (did that twice), the Cinderella Carousel and the quite amazing Mystic Manor attraction.

"532567610,4,2017-9,Australia,""This is smaller than then American equivalent but it it worth the visit. It has much of the same magic and they do quite well at making the Disney experience memorable. Remember that there are some rides that aren't open all day. The parade was good. Night time was better. Everything is on a smaller scale. If this is your first park, you will love it, if you have done Anaheim, you will notice the difference. Unlike Shanghai they have Tinkerbell.

"532248608,3,2017-10,United States,""We were traveling to Hong Kong with our children and knew we needed to do a day at Hong Kong Disneyland. The park is rather small so a day is plenty of time. The lines to the rides were 10 minutes or less and the crowds were not overwhelming. Drawbacks, although it was Disney, I felt like it was Disney at 50% effort. It was Halloween and I have been to many other parks at this time and the decorations are amazing. Hong Kong Disney had Halloween decor up, but it seemed to be the leftovers from the other parks. It was not the same feeling you get in LA, or Orlando. I am glad we went, but definitely ok with going one time in my life. Side note, the weather was miserable.

"532179238,5,2017-6,Hong Kong,""From the start it is an adventure! From the sunny bay MTR train station there is the Disney train that goes straight to the park. You could take a taxi but the train completes the Disney experience here. You should take the train. One comes every 3 mins.While quite a bit smaller than Disney in Orlando, FL, this Disney packs a lot of great things in. It has tons of great rides for the small ones and everyone else, including tea cups and dumbo. There is also Space Mountain but it is Star Wars themed and SUPER cool!!! Our favourite ride by far!!! It's like being in the scenes of the death Star battle with Tie fighters and x wings zooming in every direction. Our 7yo son thought it was a bit loud and fast but this was the first rollercoaster he has ever been on.We all really enjoyed the jungle boat ride  our guide was very funny! Tarzana tree house was also a favourite.Get your pictures with Micky, Minie, Cinderella, and all the Star Wars characters too !!!!We went on a Wednesday at 11 and it was great bc it was not crowded and we waited only 5 mins to get on rides!!!! That's almost unheard of!!!!The castle is small but still cool to see. We didn't stay for the parade. It would have made for too long a day.

Given, it's expensive but worth a try for a1st timer.. My suggestions specially during summer:  bring umbrella and your camera phone  bring a lot of water (expensive inside)  wear rubber shoes and comfortable clothings  bring face towel tissues wet & dry  try all the rides as much as you can  be a child again enjoy the ridesAnyway, my mom's 73 but still strong and healthy... she enjoyed that moment "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"531848411,3,2017-6,Singapore,""Most of the attractions are the same as the ones in Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, with the exception of Toy Story Land.They have changed some of the great attractions im Tomorrowland which I feel is a big mistake. Autopia (also known as Tomorrowland Speedway) has been shut completely and I remember there was a roller coaster ride which is also gone. However, they've replaced it with Buzz Lightyear Space Mission, which is fun   its a 1v1 laser shooting game where to hit targets to gain points. I remember I was so good at it I scored over a million points (max level) HAHA.Space Mountain ride is a must go!!! It's the same as the one in Disney World!!! Loads of fast corners and humps!!!The rest is pretty much the same so nothing much to talk about.The only thing good is with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, you will hardly see any Mainland Chinese tourists in Hk Disneyland.

"531651082,5,2017-9,United Kingdom,""We first visited this hotel 2 years ago. Once again we had a wonderful holiday, with the hotel exceeding itself.Stayed Concierge level, which was well worth the extra cost. We received fast passes for every day plus daily priority entry to the first Storybook show (which was wonderful, albeit slightly weird with Goofy, Mickey and Olaf talking in Chinese, with songs being sung in English).Breakfast was plentiful, as was the evening food. The free wine and beer each evening was very welcome and relaxing after a day exploring or visiting the park. Having Mickey, Minnie or Daisy duck visit the lounge in their pyjamas each evening was quant and something I wish Disneyworld did. Both children and adults got into the swing of things and turned up in their PJs!Was able to explore the 2 other hotels, and if we wanted to could use their facilities. The only negative was a lack of a restaurant bar at the pool. Having to order room service which took an hour was not ideal. There was a jug of water by the pool   s entrance, but sometimes water will not do, so we ended up getting dried and dressed a few times and going to the lounge just to have a cup of tea. For some reason none of the 3 hotels appeared to have food facilities at the pool     something I have not encountered before.Tip     by the annual pass for the park     we did and got a good reduction in room prices, discount at park restaurants and on shopping     well worth the money and the tickets are dirt cheap compared the Disneyworld!Can   t wait to visit again, hopefully in a year or two."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We arrived on the train at about 10am for a 10:30am opening and we breezed straight through the bag checks and joined the lines to get in. They opened Main Street early for some shopping which was perfect as we had the chance to scope out some purchases for later in the day. Most of the park opened at 10:30 and we headed straight to Adventureland to ride Jungle Cruise. They have the option for several different languages which is great for visitors that don't speak English. We then waited a few minutes for Grizzly Gulch to open and headed for a few rides on that and then Mystic Manor. They had an interactive marvel attraction thing happening which was good. Without giving a full run down of the day we pretty much managed everything we wanted to go on and saw all the parades, fireworks and special Halloween happenings. The magic book show was brill. I think it's a bit disappointing that they cancel Paint the Night for Halloween as the Halloween parade was average in comparison. Tomorrowland is a little sad at the minute with all of the renovations but we loved the Iron Man experience, a nice evolution of star tours.

There was a separate line for in house guests and day visitors at the entrance. One day is enough if you plan to just roam around the park. But those who would like to ride all the rides and witness all the live shows cannot do it all in one day since the waiting time range from 20 60 minutes and there are a lot of great attractions inside the park. I highly suggest you wear your most comfortable footwear because you will be on your feet for hours.The live shows gave me chills because it brought back a lot of childhood memories. My salute and respect to all the talents!The food was a little bit pricey but its serving is big enough for a parent to share with a child. Our favorite restaurant was Explorer's Club. Water is quite expensive there so better bring a water bottle you can refill from water fountains near comfort rooms. Speaking of comfort rooms, every attraction has a CR with many cubicles and tissue papers. There are also defibrillators located near every comfort rooms. When visiting with children, the park has strollers for rent. And they have a station for lost children where you can report a missing child (heaven forbids!).

Theres no such queuing system, it doesnt matter that you have been waiting an hour, someone will come along, pretend someone else is ahead, get to a certain point and call the rest of the family friends to push in!! Because of the language barrier i got a lot of giggles, shaking of heads and just ignored when confronted them. It happened in pretty much every queue which ruined the whole experience. Also the park is small, theres no cooling system , perhaps more sheltered areas, AC, Fanned areas, even in the queue they could have them water spritzing things, the excessive heat made it uncomfortable. Theres not enough food options, not enough international, we ate at the corner cafe but had to wait 30 mins to be seated.

It was a bit disappointing not having a water ride in HK, considering how hot it is. Two things that disappointed us was that we really struggled to find vegetarian meals that were dairy free (allergies) and the merchandise wasn   t great. We didn   t buy any merchandise.

The best rides for adults and kids over 7 were Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly runaway minecars. When it comes to food I highly recommend taking snacks and water. With the water though you can fill them up at the water stations.

530082824,5,2017-9,Philippines,Talk about being a kid again... Disneyland will still and always be the happiest place on Earth. Hyperspace Mountain is my favorite ride. I cried during the Flights of Fantasy Parade seeing my childhood virtual playmates come to life. The festival of yhe Lion King was definitely a hit! And of course the fireworks is a much watch. We booked through Klook for discounted tickets and it was definitely a great choice. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"530048726,4,2017-10,Australia,""This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them.

Very less crowd and didn't have to wait more than 5mins for any rides or shows. Took popular rides even 2 3 times. Not the case during usual days where queues take 30 45mins for popular rides.

"529459754,2,2017-10,India,""The crowd in Hong Kong in general is rude and impolite and will not think twice before pushing and shoving their way through. And this trait of those visiting Disneyland gets heightened even more. The rides have a minimum waiting time of 1 hour. Often it seems people don't even know why they were standing in a particular line. Just not worth the experience. If you just can't miss this, then at least go after 3 pm. Most rides are open till 8 and park is open till 10:30. Disappointing and just not worth it. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is brilliantly done with props and big strong voices.

"528484653,3,2017-9,United States,""Maybe September is not a big month for Disney Hong Kong or maybe it was the weather, but several rides were not open. Our biggest disappointment was that Buzz Lightyear had closed the previous weekend forever. It will be rebranded as part of a new theme being developed in that area. The line at Buzz was always not too long (like Orlando) so we would ride it over and over again. I guess we're stuck with trying to get fast passes in Orlando in the future.The Lion King was very good with some changes improvements from the last time we visited. The only bad part is the wait to get in.Hong Kong Disney size wise is nothing like Orlando so if that is what you are expecting you will be disappointed greatly. It is worth at least one visit (we've been 3 times) just to do something other than go downtown with the crowds. We've never experienced the lines of Orlando so the wait time is much shorter and you can cover all the rides easily in a day. It's just not as  magic  as Orlando and everything is smaller   even the castle. It's a small world ride is as good as Orlando though."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yes, it is truly magical as you will be seeing a lot of Disney characters you might have watched (and sometimes, your favorites)   from Princesses, to figure character and more! You will be able to meet your favorite Disney characters, watch live shows and parades, and shop and dine at all themed areas of the Hong Kong Disneyland park! HK Disneyland is accesible both via train, car and buses! Making it always on top of the lists whenever tourist planned going to Hongkong. HK Disneyland yet being so magical, is so HUGE that even (i think) a day pass would not be sufficient enough to pay a visit and enjoy everything it has to offer. They got a lot of attractions, interactive, inviting and most of all exciting.TIPS:1. Book your ticket in advance. Though getting ticket on the day itself would be fine, just to ensure you are able to manage potential hassle, I would highly suggest to book your tickets ahead. They got 1 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $70.00 to $75.00 and 2 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $90.00 to $97.00. These are e tickets that can be purchased online. Once redeemed your voucher for your physical ticket, you must enter Disneyland within 3 days. For 2 day tickets, your first entry must be within 3 days, the second within 7 days of the first visit. Child tickets will be sold to children within the age of 3 11.2. Check the weather. There are chances HK is in rainy season, so you might want to prepare your Rain Gears! If the weather is sunny, make sure you have sunscreen protection, sunglassed or umbrella. 3. Water is a must! You need to get a hand on a bottle water as surely you will be having loads of walk!4. HK Disneyland is so big and it is advisable to always refer to the maps provided on the entrance. As Disneyland also provides wi fi, might as well download their app (IOS and Android) for better schedules of attractions. better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 5. Between 2:30pm to 3:00pm (Local Time) they are hosting parade of colors which will give you a glimpse of the different disney colors.6. Between 6:00 to 6:30pm (Local Time) you will be able to witness Parade of Lights! I absolutely love this one   very stunning and spectacular.7.

I'm not saying that this park isn't fun, it's just a little bit fractured compared to other Disney parks. The lands while they exist aren't as harmonious as you might find at other parks. The difference at this park is the quality of some of their attractions. Mystic Manor is probably one of the best Disney rides ever built. Grizzly Gulch Mine Train is one of the best roller coasters on any Disney property. Best of all each one of these attractions is surrounded by a well themed land.The new Iron Man attractions are OK, but nothing worth the trip alone. The food at this park is hit or miss, depending on where you eat. This could be a one day visit, or a two day visit if you're really into Disney parks."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

On a whim my adult son and I decided to spend a day at Hong Kong Disneyland and we were not disappointed. Because we went last week when most children were in school, we did not have to wait in line for any rides which was great. There are not a ton of rides at this park but what they did have we enjoyed and we were able to do the whole park in one day without rushing around. My particular favorite rides were the Star Wars themed hyper Space Mountain and the Mystic Manor ride.I understand that this is the smallest of the Disney parks and as adult I found it relaxing and fun. I am not 100% sure that older children would be as captivated but this park is really a great size for families with smaller children. With Disney having Marvel & Star Wars rides now  I think that teenagers will be into the Disney parks too and if Disneyland Hong Kong adds more of these type rides they will get the teenagers excited about Disneyland Hong Kong too.Food was decent, the walk in ticket price was good considering I spent the whole day exploring and riding rides. The firework show was quite lovely too. Also I managed to go on the first day of the Halloween themed parades and the Hong Kong Disney Haunted House  Maze of Madness: The Nightmare Experiment Continues.

526667936,5,2017-9,Australia,We bought a 2 day pass online for a very reasonable price. Very easy to print pass or access via code through phone. Worth going about half hour before opening time at least once to see opening ceremony and get some pictures with characters on Main Street. We were lucky enough to be visiting during the Tsum Tsum Fun Fair 2017. You pay extra to participate in games where you get and can win exclusive Tsum Tsum. Staff get very excited when people win. It was fun just to have a go. During the 2 days we never waited more than 5 10 minutes for a ride and on most occasions walked straight onto the rides. Fast passes not needed at this time of year. Mystic Manor is a must do. The Lion King Show and Mickey and the magical book were also good. Pin trading is available around the park but didn't observe many people doing so. Halloween activities were also on while we were there. All free. The maze was fun but scary for little people but not in English. Halloween Villain parade was great fun. Watch out for coupons when making purchases in the park. Would happily visit this park again.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HK Disneyland is small compared to the other parks, but it has lots of surprises that make it a real gem. We visited HK Disneyland on a Wednesday. Compared to the other parks, it felt like we were the only ones there. We walked into almost every ride. We didn't bother with Fast Passes or our resort Priority Passes. Not sure if this is the norm, but it was nice. The park as a whole was very clean (as to be expected) and even in the stifling heat humidity the cast members and parade performers put on an impressive and enthusiastic show.I'm an avid fan of the Haunted Mansion. When I read about Mystic Manor, I was a little disappointed that it would not be the classic experience that I have grown to love. However, MM really blew us away. It was lighthearted and adorable. Albert is so cute. We ended up doing this attraction twice. Space Mountain seemed slower and less impressive than the other parks, but it was still fun. We walked right onto the ride, so that helped.I love Star Wars and was skeptical of the Iron Man Experience existing in place of Star Tours. Again, we walked right onto the ride, but the items they have on display in the queue seem like they would be interesting to examine and would help to pass the time if there were to be a line. The ride was fun and it excited into a ship full of Avengers merch. The Halloween decorations were cute of course. I was very impressed with Toy Story Land.

Just keep your tickets and get your hand stamped! The only bad thing is the overpriced water stations! They should have water coolers around too! Standby loads of cash for water and merchandise!!

It was a nice place for kids and kids at heart. We might go back and bring along our children so we can enjoy the moment with them .

You can also skip the long ticketing queue. Disney experience will require a full day. As i have made my visit twice to HK Disney on different occasions, my advice is try to come during the cool winter season. Under 34deg weather, you will easily go  punctured  by afternoon. Do arrive at the time of opening if you want to maximise your coverage of rides and shows. Some form of strategy is required. Bring your water bottle and keep yourself hydrated.

It's a great one day trip. Train stop begins and departs a short walking distance from the entrance. It wasn't overly crowded and we never had to wait long for any of the rides. Food was excellent for a theme park! Parade was fun, but too long to stand in the hot sun and heat. Hong Kong is very hot and humid. Our tour guide on the Jungle River Cruise was hilarious and made the ride fun. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars.

Even the Grizzly rollercoaster isn't really thrilling. Disney Hong Kong desperately needs some topattractions (Tower of Terror, Rock 'n Rollercoaster,...) The park misses the real  magic Disney feel  because of the lack of enough Disney (movie)themed rides. So no Cinderella, Snowwhite etc.Because of all this I find the ticketprice too high!On the other hand the park is really clean, the personnel are very friendly and the food is good!

Found that this time round, the place was no longer that exciting nor many things to do even though they have added in 1 new area. The toy story land was not as interesting as the one I went in Tokyo. Also the were not many rides though it was a new section. Disney service staff was also not as friendly as previously.

Judging from other reviews, September must be an ideal time to visit. We literally walked onto every ride in the park with little to no waiting. Whilst there are not a huge number of rides in this park, it was the ideal amount for us to be able to feel like we were easily able to do everything that we wanted to without any stress and still make our flight out. I would strongly advise using the MTR system to get to Disneyland. It is quick and cost effective. A big plus is the Disney train line! We made the mistake of catching a taxi to Disneyland where it cost us 10x the amount and we got caught in heavy traffic. The MTR was a lot less stressful.The 3:30 parade was a lot of fun, even for adults! Mystic Manor was my favourite ride of the day.The downside was that a number of restaurants and 2 rides were closed and I think it would have been even more fun with children!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We went on a saturday, and just from the train, I was sure that thousands would be enjoying the resort that day. We bought food before entering the gates, @70HKD each meal. Yummy! Just along the road getting inside. Lined up for inspection, and take note you're not allowed to bring meals, only snack is allowed inside. Starting from Moby Dick, picture taking starts. As soon as you enter the gates, you are greeted by Mickey Mouse on the lawn! No phone sticks are allowed! Start with Tomorrowland, then Adventure land, Toy Story, etc etc...One whole day is not enough. You go there with battery full, and end up with battery empty.

I'm not sure if it was the time of year (we went in June   and on a weekday) but the park wasn't that busy. We waited 25 mins max for probably 2 rides. The Big Grizzly Mountain mine car ride was brilliant, the queue was actually so short we were able to get off the ride and walk round to ride again and be almost straight on. We did the same with Space Mountain. We bought a ticket which included a meal at a restaurant, this was a good value and the food wasn't bad. Getting here is so simple.

Long lines for all the nice rides awaited us. Even to get a picture with the characters entailed a 30 min wait minimum. To get a lunch table, you had to dash to one when a table frees up so that you will not lose the table to another hungry group. Even then, we had fun. The weather was nice, no rains and not too cold. As we had a toddler with us, we spent a lot of time on the not so popular rides (or as my cousin would call them, wimpy rides, lol) and my daughter had so much fun. :) You can see the wonder in her eyes when she saw characters big and up close. We got fast passes for some of the rides and just waited them out sitting on some benches at the park. This is probably my third visit to this park and the first one with my daughter and husband with me. We enjoyed the shows especially the Golden Mickey show (the one with the 4D) and the Lion King. :) A not to miss attraction when you visit Hongkong, but maybe go at a non peak season so you can maximize the cost of your ticket."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"520641999,4,2017-9,Australia,""Good range of rides for all ages, only 2 real adult rides but still fun. Park is relatively small so easy enough to maximise in one day and highly recommend going when it's forecast to be cloudy or rain, it's usually sporadic and generally no queues. Recommend getting a meal voucher from Klook which is easy to use and reasonable value. You can bring your own bottle of water and refill at the park.

520392258,4,2017-8,Italy,We were 2 adults. Better to buy online the ticket to jump the queue at the box office. I think that one complete day is enough to visit the park and try almost all the attraction.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
520364951,4,2017-9,Philippines,Very good theme park. Ideal for the whole family. Very convenient transportation wise and very systematic. Though food inside the park is not really good and expensive. Kids will definitely enjoy the rides and the shows.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

519714528,5,2017-8,Egypt,We had a great day at disney hong kong . It is spacious but not crowded with rides and stages. The main street in California and the sleeping beauty castle is always busy in California but in Hong king it is only busy during the parade whichis also not as the California parade but still nice to see it . Rides has long queues but anuway worth waiting as disney rides are really great.kids enjoyed the stage live shows .the festival of lion king and mickey wonderous story book was both amazing and really the airconditined stages are teally great in the hot weather. The electric parade and fire works were nice . Shops have different stuff than California disney land .Meet and greet characters are not the same everyday and hardly you can find disney princesses.mickey and minnie are there almost all the time. It is great to visit hongkong disney park but donr put it in comparison with disneyland or WDW.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most rides and shows were open. We enjoyed the Lion King show and lined up for photo ops with Mickey and Minnie and Donald and Daisy, ride the carousel, went inside Small World , ate at Plaza Inn and shopped for souvenirs. Too bad, the parade was cancelled due to bad weather. It would have been the highlight of our granddaughter's visit."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"519216571,4,2017-8,Botswana,""We managed to get great weather and enjoyed 6 great hours of Disney fun. The park has the traditional Disney atmosphere with lots of activities and stores to keep you busy. Activities for all ages from kids to teenagers   then again which adult doesn't turn into a kid when they see Mickey Mouse. You'll need stamina to walk and if it's a busy day, you'll need patience to wait in the lines. There are no traditional fast passes, look around as each popular ride has a unique fast pass method through vending machines. The food options are basic and can get very very busy at meal times. We waited for 30 mins at one location for a table and then ended up moving to another area of the park just to get a bite. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

518856338,5,2017-8,Kenya,We loved the whole experience and the kids were over the moon to meet most of the characters. Quite full so go prepared for long waits but totally worth it. Stay till after 7 pm to see the night parade and at 9 for the fireworks show,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Seeing my daughter react to the characters and the shows made the entire trip worth it. Expect a lot of walking. Bring extra shirtS and water. Make use of the line passes that allow you to be in line without having to stand.If you must bring a baby stroller, pack 2 bags. One with your valuables and the other with non essentials. All rides and shows will require you to leave the cart outside, in a baby cart parking lot. Having separate bags will allow you to easily leave the other with the cart outside without having to sort out your things. All in all an awesome day.

"518606864,5,2017-8,Australia,""Having been to Florida and California Disney World land this is smaller and lacks the memorabilia that the USA ones have on show and around the park, rides are the same, parade was great and the park is very well kept. Pricey for food and drink but so is every Disneyland, less shops and restaurants but enough for its size. Rides pretty much the same but lines not as long as USA. Transport to here via MTR and cab was very easy. Fireworks over the castle were awesome we would come back with our family "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"518561302,5,2017-8,United States,""We live in Florida and have been frequent visitors of Disney World there, originally with children and now with grandchildren. We were a little skeptical about the experience we would have at the smaller Disneyland Hong Kong, when we visited it last week, but we were most pleasantly surprised how they have been able to replicate the engaging  Magic  on somewhat smaller but equally entertaining scale. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
518400477,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,I came here expecting it to be rammed with people and even though there were a lot the park seemed to cope pretty well with the mass volume of visitors. We caught the MTR to Sunny Bay and then caught the train   this was quite magical as a Disney themed train takes you to the theme park. Trains were very frequent so no waiting around . Queues were not too bad I think the longest was 35 mins which is acceptable in summer holidays . With the busier rides we used a fast track ticket (note there is no extra cost!!) and returned in the given time slot . After 5pm the crowds eased off and rides were easy to get on. Park is very easy to manoeuvre around   not too far to walk from one area to another. All very child friendly the staff very good and helpful   lots speaking very good English too. Top attraction for me was Hyperspace mountain   the children loved the Buzz Light year ride. Also enjoyed the Mystic mansion   great animation here. Watched the Lion King show   wow fantastic my daughter absolutely loved this . We stayed to watch the Night Parade   this was incredible ! Very pretty to see the floats all illuminated . Great Iron man ride if you don't get motion sickness   there was no queue here we went straight on . Food   you can't take your own food in and they do check your bags at the gate. Park food is expensive that is the downside   be prepared to part with money to buy the Disney brand . There are lots of outlets to eat from   food is  ok  standard . If you are feeling flush I can highly recommend a Disney themed ice cream   they were delicious but $45 a go ! So remember when its busy you can scan you entrance ticket in the fast track machine by the popular rides to get a slot time to return with no queue   there is a list of rides that have this feature on their web site. Great day out at Disney and they give you a nice fireworks display to close off your evening !,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"517379789,2,2017-8,Canada,""Was quite disappointed with the park and should have done some research. We were mostly disappointed about the small size of the park and lack of rides compared to its North American and even EuroDisney counterparts. It's quite far from HK but easy to get to by MTR although you will need to transfer a couple of time. It doesn't need more than 1 day to get through it. We bought 2 day tickets but actually did not regret it as the heat in August is oppressive and we could only stay for a few hours at a time. Favourite rides were the Grizzly Gulch train and Mystic Manor (as it was air conditioned). Hyperspace mountain was OK   Star Wars themed now but pretty tame coaster compared to the updated Space Mountains in other parks. Meet and greet with the Star Wars characters was also a highlight though. On the 2nd day, it rained a little and all the outdoor rides closed. Also all the food vendors shut down as well. Can't imagine what we would have done if we bought the food voucher. If you've been to other Disney parks, prepare to be disappointed. If this is your first time to Disney, you get a taste of what the original is like so you will likely have much more fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"516691508,5,2017-6,Philippines,""It is smaller than Tokyo Disneyland, but getting a 2 day pass is still a must. Everything about Hongkong Disneyland was fun for our family. The staff were nice (they can speak english relatively fluently), the rides were fun, the shows and parades were great and the food was superb.The only cons about Hong Kong Disneyland is the price (but typical of any theme park).Tips:1. GET A 2 DAY PASS (so you can see all the shows and try out all the rides).2. Be there at rope drop (10:30am) in order to enjoy the entire day in HK Disneyland (the staff and photographers are happier and more energetic in the morning).3. Tell your kids to get stickers from ANY ALL staff member s early in the day (by late afternoon, they run out of stickers).4. If you will get the photopass, don't forget to ask the staff with cameras that are roaming around to take your picture (the day pass is worth it if you maximize the roaming photographers). And don't forget to have the staff at each ride (where your photos are taken. I.e. Hyperspace mountain) scan your photopass card to save your photo.5. AVOID the souvenir shops (unless you really want to buy a souvenir or two), these will take a lot of your time especially if you are with kids.6. Check out klook.com and the hk disneyland website for promo day passes and 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 meal coupons (these coupons are cheaper compared to buying food ala carte). Compare the prices on the websites before purchasing.7. Plan your day ahead. Look at the map and schedules available on the HK disneyland app or website.8. Try to watch both the afternoon parade and the night parade (around 8pm).9. ENJOY YOUR DAY!P.S. the staff strickly enforce the  no outside food policy . But they are lenient with water bottles and baby formula. Bring a water bottle or two (Bottled water is expensive inside the theme park. There are drinking fountains around the theme park and HK tap water is potable, but you can taste the chlorine.)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We walked around the whole thing in a matter of a couple hours. The rides aren't the greatest, but there are some fun ones to hit, especially Mystic Manor!

"515370092,5,2017-8,United States,""After having visited Shanghai Disneyland a few days prior (it was just  meh ), Hong Kong Disneyland was a welcome respite! Lines were short, fast passes were readily available (though unnecessary), facilities (Park and Explorer's Lodge Hotel) were immaculate, and Cast Members exuded the Disney magic! Our longest wait time of the day was 20 minutes for RC Racer. We did Hyper Space Mountain, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly Gulch multiple times. We Fastpassed Winnie the Pooh, just for the sake of doing a Fastpass, but it really wasn't necessary as the hotel had given us 6 priority access passes. We only used 4 of the priority passes throughout the day. Lines were orderly and the Park was very clean. The food offerings at the Park were quite good too! We tried for the Mango Dole Whip at Jessie's Snack Roundup, but they didn't seem to carry it any longer. Instead we had the pineapple smoothie with ice cream and a churro on the side. Both were very good! We ate at the Starliner Diner for lunch, it's typical Disney quick service.We took a cab from HKG to Explorer's Lodge, but took the MTR back into the city after our Disney visit. The cab was around 145 HKD, while the MTR to the city was around 60 HKD (2 adults and one child).Like most Disney Parks (except Shanghai Disney), we were truly sad to leave Hong Kong Disneyland, and hope to be back soon!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rides, shows, meet and greet session with Disney characters, a parade of Disney stars, and an impressive fire works display to cap off the day just to name a few. Just like the Hong Kong Ocean Park, I personally wish that the shows were done in English rather than Cantonese.

The crowds are mostly from mainland China, and most of them would probably try to jump queue, if not they'd stand really close behind you whilst you're waiting in line for no apparent reason.Even if you're not participating in any of the rides, make sure to prepare yourself with an umbrella, hat, water and sunscreen. The waiting areas are not sheltered and you could be left sitting in the scorching heat.The good thing about Hong Kong Disneyland, is that the rides have three languages.

Getting to Disneyland was easy and the rides were also pretty great. You can get a fast pass for some of the rides where there is a long wait or you could go for other rides in the meantime. The only downside for this was that, it was not available for all the rides and you had to wait for it no matter what, which was frustrating and tiring. The universal studios in Singapore had a better system where you could get an express pass by paying extra and skip the ques and save on a good 2 3 hours. The weather is also known to change pretty quick so remember to get an umbrella. The cost for the tickets was around 600 HKD pp and it was cheaper to buy the tickets at the airport.

The Fantasyland is the best, next is the Tomorrowland and the Magical shows. Inside Disneyland, there are good enough restaurants, food prices are of course high. Comfort rooms are airconditioned, so that as you go around, you will find comfort in their comfort rooms. The only thing that is a drawback was the comfort rooms were not consistently attended to by janitors because most of these smelled of urine. It was a Tuesday when we went there, expectedly there were not too many people but alas, there were a lot of guests. Nevertheless, I'm giving two thumb up to this place. The Parade of Lights and Firecrackers show were worth the wait and the visit. Never miss these events happening at 9:15 PM everyday."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"512562596,4,2017-8,Philippines,""It's Disneyland, what can you possibly say except that kids would definitely love coming here for the rides and the other attractions. It was a lot of fun and their parade is a great thing to wait for and experience. It was incredibly HOT though when we visited and I was thinking it'd probably be best to avoid these summer days next time. But aside from that   which is by no means or possibility Disney's fault   it was definitely a lot of fun for the kids and us kids at heart alike."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"512543576,5,2017-8,Switzerland,""We went there with 5 kids and 4 adults. It was lots of fun. You can go with even small kids to good rides, for most of the rides you just have to be 1.04m.

"512395501,4,2017-7,United States,""Went to Shanghai Disneyland what a big difference when we went to Hong Kong Disneyland. It's like night and day!! Less crowded the people are not rude, no cutting lines everyone waits their turn. Really enjoyed seeing the Tarzan play it highlighted the Chinese acrobatic talent. That was probably my favorite show at Disneyland. Because it is not crowded we were able to see and cover more of the park in less hours. We only had time for about half day   4 hours and it was plenty enough time to cover what we wanted to see and do. All in all this is a pleasant experience and worth going to visit despite everyone saying it's so small and not worth it. Believe it I enjoyed myself here more than Shanghai Disneyland. Thumbs up for Hong Kong Disneyland and the people have more class here and wait patienty their turn."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

512072548,3,2017-8,Italy,The park is limited with its restaurants and outlets you can't even get a bottle of water without waiting in line !! And shouldn't water be free ...? The rides are outdated and old style compared to other theme parks ... the worst was the Spider Man adventure !! You wait in line cooking for an hour just to be shuttled into a closed 2 x 2 room with a Chinese guy dressed in a Spider Man suit who only speaks Chinese and asks if you want a photo and that's it!! Seriously ?? Disney you are off my list ...hands down worst ever ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
511993586,5,2016-9,Philippines,Disneyland will really make you go back to ur childhood days. It was awesome to see Snow White and Mickey Mouse.

The park is smaller than those in Paris and Tokyo however, it was still in line with the wonderful Disney experience. The park also has loads of special offers and special discounts that you can find by signing up on their free Wifi service and staff members handing out coupons. The only downside was that we purchased a dining plan and although the  fine print  says that you can use it for ice pops at carts around the park, management failed to provide the staff at the cards with the equipment necessary to process the QR coded vouchers."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I thought I'd see a HUGE Disney castle and watch my kids faces explode with excitement. I thought I'd find some healthy food options.....Alas, none of those thugs happened for us. I thought the staff would be super happy and friendly (like the Disney adverts!) but only the cleaners were. The retail staff were totally vacant!I appreciated the  fast pass  system, but wish that had been extended to other rides so our under 5yr olds didn't have to queue 30mins for a 2min ride on a teacup. The best time of day for us was the last 30mins before the park closed whilst everyone was waiting for the parade and the queues cleared. Bliss. I can't say I'll go back.

All in all a slick well run operation...Disney does it right after decades of experience you'd expect nothing less from the moment you step on the Disney train with the Mickey Mouse ears...One worthy note, the fast track tickets are only valid at specific times for rides and attractions. You may arrive at an attraction only to find a sign saying come back in an hour...as with most places in HK if you visit at the W E or public holiday, there's gonna be long queues.

But, HK Disney is still Disneyland : ) My only comment would have to be that some of the shows were in Chinese, because it is in HK! but they could have considered that there are many foreigners too who would have loved Mickey Mouse to speak in English not in Mandarin (?). But all in all, still loved Disneyland!!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I felt like it lacked atmosphere and didn't have as many rides as I would have expected. Food outlets were limited and I wouldn't recommend the western food. The staff were friendly. This is the only Disney park I haven't felt the  magic  and probably wouldn't return there. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"509863604,1,2017-8,United States,""Embarrassed for Mr. Walt Disney. The park was created in 2005. Disney had a blank slate to create a world class park. Instead they created an embarrassing tourist trap, that offered an uninspiring place to capture your money only. If Walt was alive he would have fired the person in charge of new park development.... Don't waste your time and don't waste your money at this park.

I imagine at a weekend during school holidays it will get very crowded, but we were able to get on all the things we wanted to without big queues.One or Two day passes are on sale. I cannot see how it could take more than one day to do everything, even with children in tow. In all a very pleasant day out."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
509570313,5,2017-6,Australia,We had a absolute amazing time here and I highly recommend it for young families. To get the full feel of the park I would suggest two days so kids can have a couple turns on the rides. We did a morning to early afternoon for the first day and then a late afternoon till the end of night fireworks the second day and it was well worth it. International travellers should definitely take advantage staying at one of the 3 resorts which offer free shuttles all day long.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

509157718,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,Went with our 10yr old on what we hoped would not be a rainy day. It is a nice park and easy to get round. We went mid week so the queues for the rides were quite small and there was enough variety to keep her interest. We arrived about 1 2hr after it opened and we had about 4 1 2hrs before it started to rain. A few of the rides were kept open and only lightening made them stop completely. We stayed till the end anyway and saw the fireworks but the parade was cancelled. If you get there when it opens & stay the full day I don't think you need more than a day to get round but if it's busy and you have young children 2 days might be better.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although the rides do not have the same thrill and excitement level as compared to Ocean Park, HK Disneyland well makes up for it in other ways bringing out your inner child with the familiarity of the Disney franchises. We really love some of the rides like the big grizzly mountain runaway mine, RC car, Disney express, mystic manor and it's a small world. Not to mention the parade and firework finale which was both the highlight of our visit at the theme park.Compliments also to the staff for the efficient crowd control during the fireworks.

508392418,4,2017-8,Australia,Amazing park perfect for young children maybe not so much young adults but as not many adult rides. My kids absolutely loved it from the rides to meeting their favorite characters. To be expected everything is expensive costing near $5 aud for water. But its a smaller very well maintained park with alot smaller wait times then the Anaheim park. Loved it. The only reason its 4 not 5 is prices.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

508101644,3,2017-8,New Zealand,I was really looking forward to HK Disney for my daughter's 5th birthday but felt a bit let down by the experience. The queues were too long and there were no princesses or charterers to be seen except at the end in the parade. The staff were not very cheerful and people pushed in all the time in the lines. They should have a priority queue for people with young kids as it seems unfair that all these adults are taking up the queue space while kids have to stand exhausted in the lines. Also the Disney characters were nowhere to be seen. Standing in queues with small children for a 5 minute ride is not that fun! Still my daughter enjoyed it!

"507454812,4,2017-1,Thailand,""We went just after they open the Iron man ride. Kids loved it! we even went twice. A good tip is to go during the week day, and avoid the national holiday, and school holiday, as it get very crowded. By going during the week, we barely wait more than 5 min per ride. Don't miss the new StarWars mountain, steeper, and faster than the Space mountains."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"507251039,5,2017-5,United States,""Took the Metro from hotel to Disney. You take the Metro to the Disney line   then get on trains that are decked out with Mickey Ears windows and Disney character statues inside the train. Our car was covered in blue fabric with white walls. Very clean and fun for all to experience.Arrive at Disney and walk to the entrance    with security checks before entry to the park. As we were seniors, we got the cheapest rate in HK$. We felt this price is cheaper than what we pay to enter the parks at Disneyland or DisneyWorld.We were amazed at how clean the park was    how friendly the people were and because we were American's, everyone wanted to take their photo with us. Cell phones are everywhere. Seem to be glued to their hands, just like here in America! So now we are in lots of photo albums there in China!There are a few Disney characters who come out   but be warned they don't do autographs. Pin trading is something new to them so not many people trade";" however, the Disney crew did have the lanyards for those of us who are traders! The majority of the pins were what you see at the US parks, but we were able to chat with a few crew and one of them was a trader who traded a really nice pin she had collected for one of ours that we had brought with us. So it was fun.Duffy is the popular character it seems    but that might be because Easter. Spring and Easter was the theme parks decor while we were there.It rained off and on that day but the weather was hot, so the brief showers brought out umbrellas, of which we had none, so we just walked around in the rain to cool off! Went on 2 rides, walked around to enjoy the experience and ate lunch before leaving the park about 3 to take the metro back to the hotel.A great place for kids of all ages naturally, but there were a lot of families there with young children and teens out on Spring break, Also we as senior kids!There is a Pandora charm store on location with all the Disney Pandora charms available for purchase."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

507148671,5,2016-8,India,We had full masti for the time we were in disneyland. We were dropped at the gate by our travel guide and had less than 12 hrs to explore it and make the best of it. The tips dat i cud quote which we used in this travel are1) we took out the complete map of disneyland and decided the approx time we wanted to spend in each area.2) although u wish to stay n breathe n njoy the surroundings but i promise u vl miss on alot of stuff so Rush!!3) u should not at all wear high heels or ne sort of uncomfortable boots or heels and must carry small racksacks (shoulder bags) for water n stff. Wear smthng cool n smart.4) we are pure vegetarians so by majboori we had no tym to waste on tryng food stfs5) enter ur first choice from right or left. It is tomorrowland or main street usa resp. I vl prfr tomorrowland cz u vl wsh fr sm small rides n nice views and then u cn follow the road.6) best part  spread.. we made our parents stand separately in queues of different rides so dat on njoyng one we cd run for another. Also one shd avoid rushy areas.. i.e. Dnt enter whr rush is entering. After sometime you will find it a lot easier space to njoy.DONT WASTE TYMDo njoy the night show. Dnt wrry abt takng d frst place near the boundary lines of the castle.. its fire crackers so focus on wats happng overhead,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
506958560,5,2017-7,China,Hong Kong Disneyland is fantastic! It captures all of the traditional Disney elements whilst also putting it's own spin on things. The park is incredibly easy to navigate and well set out.Waits times are sooooooo much less here than at other Disneyland Resorts around the World.

"506337938,5,2017-5,Philippines,""Disneyland was indeed the happiest place I've been when I was in Hongkong. Although it was quite far from the place we were staying still, I enjoyed so much even from the start of the travel. They had their own Disney train where you can sit in a luxurious seat.

"506329203,3,2017-5,United States,""A one day pass for HK Disney cost us about $100 USD per person, which, for what you get, isn't really worth the cost. If you've already seen Disney World and or Disneyland in the US, HK Disney may disappoint you. Comparatively, it's very small. It's basically a tiny Magic Kingdom without many of the classic rides   no Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, etc.There are a couple of rides exclusive to HK Disney that are pretty neat. In particular, Mystic Manor is a very fun, smartly designed Haunted Mansion esque ride that I'd highly recommend.Disney fanatics might also want to check out some of the merchandise. There's more than enough of it, and much of it is exclusive to HK Disney.The food is much nicer fancier than the Disney parks food in the US, but it's also considerably more expensive.Getting there via the MTR was fairly easy, though it's a bit of a hike from Hong Kong Island or Kowloon. Getting back was a bit more difficult, since we left with the hordes of other people leaving right after the fireworks show that begins as the park closes. (The show was great, for what it's worth.)We went on a Tuesday, and there weren't many crowds or long lines. The park actually felt oddly empty. Then again, we were there on a holiday (Dragon Boat Festival), which may have kept a lot of people away, so take that with a grain of salt."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

In my 7th visit to a Disney Resort, this time in Hong Kong, I was with a group of five office mates who momentarily forgot they were not kids anymore. Or they simply don't care because, after all, they are in the happiest place on Earth.While the HK Disneyland is the smallest among the different Disney Resorts around the world, it still pays to be early to beat the crowd. Visit Disney on a weekday when there are fewer visitors (but don't underestimate the word 'fewer'). It is best to be in front of the ticket booths before 9:30AM so that you can join the impatient visitors who make a mad dash to the nearest attractions once they open at 10AM. And that's exactly what we did. Tomorrowland (Space Mountain, Iron Man, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters in succession). Then off to Toy Story Land (Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, RC Racer Roller Coaster, Slinky Dog Spin) , then to Grizzly Gulch (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (my favorite!). So many more rides, so little time.Don't forget to watch The Lion King Show (various times), Philharmagic (4D), the Disney Characters Parade at 4:00PM, the Light the Night Parade at 8:00PM, and the Fireworks Display at 9:00PM.At P3,800  (HK$589), a one full day trip to Disneyland will always be worth every peso (or dollar) you pay."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
505457836,4,2017-7,Philippines,                                       Fantastic experience!!! Must for families with children or group of friends.   Try to visit Hong Kong during winter.     ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"505378052,4,2017-7,Malaysia,""I have an awesome experience in Hong Kong Disneyland although I cannot play all the attraction. I reached HKDL around 11am and there are quite a number of people queuing at the security check and waited 10 mins. Maybe we visit weekday, we just waited 10 mins to enter the park. It was fast. Please make sure you go to Toy Story Land to play the attraction first. Because the waiting time for Toy Story Land is more than 60 mins. Then only go get the fast pass ticket for the Iron Man Attraction Hyper Space Mountain Winnie The Pooh attraction. Lastly, make sure you wait till the end to watch the fireworks, it was super nice."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"505352119,5,2017-7,United States,""We love Hong Kong Disneyland. This is a much different than the Anaheim resort. The meal deal is an exceptional value and Space Mountain, StarWars edition is better at the Hong Kong Resort. Grizzly Gulch runaway train is the very best ride. We loved the Lion King live show and the other shows. The variety of foods should be available in Anaheim along with the discount senior admission. The customer service is amazing and the air conditioned waiting areas for the major attractions are amazing. It may be smaller but the customer service and prices makes this the best Disney Resort."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
505279192,4,2017-7,Australia,A lovely small Park with plenty of adventures waiting for young Children. My 4 year old and 3 year old sons haven't stopped talking about it since. Plenty to see and do with a good variety of World wide cuisines,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"505008892,4,2017-5,United Arab Emirates,""It was a an awesome experience, despite not riding everything due to a long queue which is normal in a leisure park. I so love the evening parade and the fire works. Except for food and water which are expensive."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"504745592,4,2017-4,Indonesia,""We went there on summer, and the heat just almost unbearable.The rides, however, really fun.

Basically, just as expected from a Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"504629826,4,2017-7,Singapore,""We visited this place 10 years ago with our girls , most of it are the same except one or two new land ( like the Toy story ) .It was very hot becos it is summer , and everyone will look for a air conditioner cafe but there are not many plus it is Jam pack with loads of tourists. if you have young children , it is better to bring an umbrella with a portable fan for each child . Q up for rides and show is not really that long but for some famous ride , it will take up about half hour to an hour Q up time , sometime the area is not air condition so do remember to have water and some snacks for kids to keep them entertained .If you are travelling with young children , do remember when the last show ends , there will be a lot of them leaving together, so it will take up at lest half hour trying to go to their Disney train b4 changing to MTR , so your travel time to go home will now be at lest half more than your original time ."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
504343629,3,2017-7,Australia,For kids who are looking for rides with a little thrill this place leaves a lot to be desired. Overall not a great place to visit but been there done that may apply.Food is expensive and service is lacking. Very difficult to find a young person smiling outside of the performers. The other thing is just a heads up. Many of the rides or exhibits that have voiceovers don't have great English. We could barely understand which detracted from the experience. Not complaining just worth noting if you are expecting all communication to be understood.The lines were not that bad but we went on a Friday.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"504327918,2,2016-8,Hong Kong,""Disneyland is a fantasy for everyone, guess everybody read and watch about the stories and surely would like to see it in person. That's why everybody is excited about Disneyland. Especially those ones in Western World. However, the one in Hong Kong was too small to put everything together. Therefore they can only selected some themes they thought can attract more visitors. Unfortunately they failed. Once can compare with those one in France or US, You will found the one in Hong Kong is waste of time to visit, you will encounter only queuing but without fun. Further, you will be pushed to dine within the site and found they are robbing you. But in a while if you have nothing to do and have spare money in your pocket then you can tell your friends that you have been one more Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
504091022,5,2017-7,Bahrain,It was truly a great experience. We had a 2 day pass. Iron man experience was the best enjoyed by my 14 year old son. Since it was july we were disturbed lot by rain. But still it was exciting. The Tarzan tree house and the raging river rides were quite a different experience. Monkey's philar magic was simply out of the world. I am truly left short of words to describe.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"503964199,5,2017-7,United States,""Disclosure: I grew up near Walt Disney World (WDW) and have been there 100  times. I only recently visited the original Disneyland, and then a few days later visited Hong Kong Disneyland for the first time. Overall Impression: My husband and I really enjoyed this park, and it was our favorite when compared to Disneyland Anaheim or California Adventure. It's much smaller than WDW, but that is part of what makes it charming. Travel: We rode the Disneyland Express MTR, which was adorable. The Mickey windows and various Disney details on the train cars were adorable. That said, we opted for a cab on the way home to avoid the need for several trains. There is a cab area with clear designations about which cabs go to which parts of Hong Kong.Best Rides:Mystic Manor     I have a love affair with the Haunted Mansion, so I was surprised when I ended up loving Mystic Manor even more. One of the best rides I   ve ever done at any Disney park. There   s a lot of great story which is a nice bonus, but really the ride itself just really unique. I   ve never been on anything quite like it. It   s trackless, and the mansion just feels HUGE and grandiose in a way I wasn   t expecting. We loved it so much we rode it twice.Hyperspace Mountain     To be fair, we didn   t ride Space Mountain at Disneyland, in part because the Hyperspace Mountain elements were already removed from that one. But Hyperspace Mountain at HKD was AWESOME. There   s something to be said for rocketing off with Star Wars music blaring, and tie fighters and X Wings shooting all around you. So much fun we rode it twice.Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars     So many twists and turns with this coaster that were unexpected and a lot of fun. At first glance it looked like a Big Thunder Mountain copy cat, but it was SO much better than that.Iron Man Experience     This was a pretty classic simulator, but we enjoyed it quite a bit. Lots of fun, and not nearly as    jerky    as Star Tours. In fact, I thought the ride was pretty smooth and enjoyable, whereas a lot of simulators usually leave me feeling a little sick.Honorable Mentions: The Festival of the Lion King show at HDK. Not a ride, but a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I had never done this at Animal Kingdom, and with HK being so horribly hot and humid in summer, it was a perfect break. Food thoughts: We ate lunch in Tomorrowland. My husband got an Iron Man burger that actually had the Iron Man helmet logo on the bun. I got fried chicken, which came with little plastic gloves to keep your hands from getting messy. Never seen that before, but helpful!Lines and Crowds: We visited Hong Kong Disneyland on a Friday. We never waited more than 30 minutes for anything. For Hyperspace Mountain we walked right on the first time with barely a 5 minute wait. We did pass up some Marvel meet and greets due to 60 minute wait times though. Getting food at all three parks was surprisingly painless. No long lines for food and no stalking tables to find a spot to eat. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
503933901,5,2017-7,Philippines,Had my my kids 4th birthday here. Had 1 week to be around Hong Kong but made sure to spend majority of our stay here. Checked in the disney hotel and spent 2 nights. The best thing about disneyland is seeing your kid have an unlimited fun. That is priceless,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"503869280,5,2017-7,United Kingdom,""Loved, loved, loved this place! We visited as a family with my thirteen year old and I wasn't sure if he would be too old. This was a needless worry as he lost the teenage attitude immediately and to my horror, introduced me to his idea of roller coaster heaven.There's a wide range of rides to suit most children and in particular enough for young children to be happy (and the parents who don't like the scary rides).Note that you are not allowed to take food or drink into the park and bags are searched. Some of our party were turned away to dispose of this. I understand for commercial reasons that this is to encourage buying within the park.Each area is different   fantasyland, tomorrow and, adventure land. I recommend The Lion King show. The singing and visuals were superb.We visited on a day of very mixed weather and with very little notice, the afternoon parade was cancelled. My impression is that they readily cancel parades here if the weather isn't good. The evening parade and the fireworks more than made up for this though. It's very easy to get to and is part of Lantau Island. The MTR from Hong Kong stops at Sunnybay where you take the Disneyland express MTR to the park. Everything Disney starts here with the cut out Mickey Minnie windows on the train.We wished we had bought a two day pass instead of one day. There's only   5 difference in ticket price. I would definitely come back here on a future trip to Hong Kong."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
503823675,5,2017-7,Vietnam,We took our daughter here for her first Disney experience and she absolutely loved every minute.  We didn't get to go on as many rides as we would have liked.  The wait was just too long.  Buy your tickets in advance.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

503594935,5,2016-8,Hong Kong,First of all speak to the locals in town at your hotel maybe as all employees at d land get free daily access to family and friends .that will save you at least half the fee .also make the local very happy also no queues.Secondly take a packed lunch or have a big breakfast for the price and quality of food and drinks you may as well go to the real one in USA.It's great for kids split into 2 groups as to see what everyone wants faster and no hanging around because one person wants to ride the train .etc etc etc .on the way back to hk stop of at kowloon area to see pet street with the real Mac oh. Eat around there and get a filling freash and tasty meal cheaply .or go and see the light show at eight or nine pm I think .please check.All in all a fun and tiring day take a buggy for the small one and sensible Sun hats and protection,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"503538782,1,2017-7,United Kingdom,""On the day, it was a choice of either Ocean Park or Disneyland. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, we decided to go to disneyland. Travelling there was pretty easy by MTR and rail. However, on the way, we were met by hordes of Chinese mainlanders, each going to the same destination. They are loud and rude and where there is a queue, they will certainly try to skip it. Sadly, this was the main theme throughout the day. After queuing at the entrance, and fighting off every single mainlander's attempt to jump the queue, we finally got in. The sun was shining and it was extremely hot. My advice is to take an umbrella or parasol with you to shade yourself, because there is very little shade indeed within the park. Queuing for the rides wasn't so bad. They are pretty fast, and you can select a time to return to save yourself some time. This is certainly what you must do for the more popular rides. The rides are generally suitable for children and even those who are afraid of rollercoasters can enjoy them without a fuss. But you must ensure that no one skips in front of you while queuing. Since there are no shades within the park, you are always on the lookout for a shop to relieve yourself with aircon. Although, there are some areas with aircon, there are also many shops that don't have it. I find it pretty cheap that they can't even turn the aircon on after you pay so much to get in.The food courts are jammed pack. You'd be extremely lucky to get a seat. The mainlanders all rush to get their food and the whole place is absolutely chaotic. It's probably the worse experience you will ever have. Fortunately, they serve the food pretty quickly and you don't have to wait long in the queue.By the end of the day, I was so knackered, I just couldn't move anymore. The heat, the exhaustion, the constant need to fight off queue jumping. Chinese mainlanders will not observe any etiquette and it got me completely mad. I cannot recommend this experience to anyone."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
503503315,5,2017-6,India,Cutely smaller in size but perfect for a day outing with kids (3 years   99 years) there is every thing for everyone. Do stay till the end to watch the parade and lighting crackers show,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"503473599,5,2017-6,India,""This is the world's smallest Disneyland but still it manages to give you one of the best experiences of life. It caters to all age groups and hence it is great fun to be in. There is a lot to walk once you are inside so if you are travelling with kids make sure to get a pram. There are different shows as well like the Lion King show, etc. but they take place only at particular time points so make sure you plan accordingly and don't miss the shows. There are two parades which take place inside the park one in the afternoon at around 3 and the second in the evening at around 7, both of them are equally great, so one should try and attend both. The fire works show happens in the night at around 8:30 and that too is worth watching. It is recommended to keep yourself hydrated all day as it is pretty hot in the month of June in Hong Kong. An amazing overall experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"503235271,3,2017-7,Philippines,""The month of July is not a very ideal time to visit Hong Kong. It was raining the day we arrived in Hong Kong and on the day that we are supposed to be visiting HK Disneyland, it rained 75% of the time. My little one whose 5 years old still was able to enjoy the Disney park special thanks to other Disney characters who bravely came out to Fantasy Garden to greet us despite of unfortunate rainy condition. The Disney Parade was cancelled and of course the fire works. We were disappointed but not that much, my little princess was still able to enjoy the tour at  It's a small world , which I believe is the second highlights of her very first visit to HK Disneyland. You can't really do anything if Mother nature wants to rain. BUT I can still try to come back next time with my little princess and I am hoping in December it'll be a different experience...a much more enjoyable and worth Disney vacation. I am still giving HK Disneyland a 5 star ratings because if it didn't rained, I know my little princess would have enjoyed the Disney tour. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"501469893,5,2017-2,Australia,""I would recommend pre purchasing tickets online, showing up early, and going during the week and non school holiday periods to beat the crowds.

There are plenty of rides for all ages. Make sure you read the guide at the beginning of your day and plan your day well to see as many performances as you can.The food is terrible and overprice but that always happens with theme parks. Remember to pack some extra water and snacks to sustain you throughout the day. Make sure to bring lots of money because everything is so cute and you will probably end up buying lots of souvenirs.If you're going to Hong Kong then definitely set aside a day to visit Disneyland.

When my wife bought me and two of our (older) kids tickets to Disneyland, though, we embraced the chance to go, and it was a wonderful experience for which we are and will remain grateful. Due to some time constraints we got to enjoy five rides, namely the Iron Man Experience, the Runaway Mine Carts, the Mystic Manor, the Toy Story Parachute Drop and the Toy Story RC racer. As long as the lines we had to endure were, it was still time well spent. We particularly enjoyed the Mystic Manor and the Disneyland HK exclusive Iron Man Experience, which we rode before anything else. As virtual 4 D rides go, it was a topnotch experience, though the more traditional rides were also quite enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and very helpful, and the food, while pricey, was nonetheless good, with a good range of variety (East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine), and generous servings. The layout of the place is very friendly and easy to cover by foot so it shouldn't even be that hard for small children to get around, though given the size of the crowd it's really advisable to keep an eye on smaller kids.I can definitely see myself going back, perhaps when my younger kids are big enough for the rides."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"500960346,5,2017-6,United States,""Disneyland Hong Kong (a Thursday in June 2017) from the Royal Plaza Hotel in Mongkok was easy to get to by MTR (purchase an Octopus card). It was about a 35min ride. It was about $75 US dollars for 1day admission (tickets purchased at the park). The one day pass is enough to see most of the park. It was a very hot sticky day. I suggest a lot of sunscreen, dri fit clothes, a cooling towel, water, and an umbrella (especially its typhoon season and you never know when it will rain). It says online that a selfie stick is not allowed but we saw many with them. You can bring your own water, but no canned or glass bottles. There is security check. The staff or cast members as they are called, are not so friendly as SoCal Disney and Disneyworld Florida. They have  Western  bathrooms and they have seat covers and toilet paper (if you have ever been around China, you know why I mentioned this). They also take Visa charge cards. It is about a third of the size of Disneyland SoCal. We got there about 10:30am. The park is sectioned off similar to Disneyland SoCal, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Adventureland are a few familiar areas. The Disney Characters do not walk around the park. On Main Street, they have a couple of designated areas that they give guest picture opportunities. I don't blame them, who would want to walk around in that costume in weather such as Hong Kong. The Winnie the Pooh ride had a really long line, which is ironic because the Winnie the Pooh ride in California has the shortest line. We decided to skip this ride. Grizzly Gulch seems to be the most thrilling compared to the other rides. Mystic Manor was my favorite ride, but then again I'm not big on rollercoasters. Ironman was a good ride too. The lines for the other rides are not too long, about 30 minutes wait. The shows are great, especially Lion King (A C was heaven). The park seemed to get a little busier at around 5:30pm. We guess the locals are off work. We stayed right before the park closed (10:30am  8pm). The park hours that day was 10 9pm) we didn't want to wait till after the ending parade then we would be with a large crowd on the MTR (watch out for pickpocketers). We had a good time.

500562511,5,2017-7,Australia,What an exciting experience. It's perfect for all the family. Kids and Adults alike. Expect long lines for some rides though. Wise to take your own packed lunch and snacks if you can. Avoid the fast food outlets but I highly recommend some caramel popcorn. Fireworks and parade are worth the late night. Enjoy! ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
500558417,1,2016-9,United States,I have been to Disney World in Florida once and Disneyland in Californis numerous times. Both are world class entertainment facilities for young and old alike.

"500472562,5,2017-6,United States,""I go to the the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, CA very often (I am an annual pass holder) so I was very excited to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. I was very happy with what they have at HK Disneyland. Hyperspace Mountain is my favorite ride in Anaheim so I was very happy to find out that the one in HK was very similar and just as entertaining. I also loved the Iron Man ride in HK Disneyland. It is very similar to the Star Tours version that they have in Anaheim. The snacks there are quite pricey but my cousin and my sister were very happy to find snacks that were good. My sister got the Korean squid that you can purchase around the park and that was very good. I got the churro sundae in Toy Story Land and I really liked it. Especially because it was so hot in HK. Another ride that me, my sister and my cousin liked was the Grizzly Bear Mountain Cars ride. It is a great ride and should be one that everyone aims to go on. It was a good trip, don't forget to drink a lot of water. The train ride to the park is very convenient. I look forward to going again!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

For the transportation i suggest you to take a fast train (disneyland train) from your nearby station, it quite far so be ready for transit and stops. But overall isn't hard to follow the map!

I was never a fan of rides and amusement parks, but Hongkong Disneyland somehow captured the kid in me. Lol. We had a great time enjoying the rides and the shops were captivating and irresistible. You just want to buy those souvenirs and take them home. But just a tip though  make sure to check the weather prior to your visit. It rained when we went there so it's best to bring a raincoat, especially for kids. The food are bit pricey but there are lots of choices when it comes to dining. Also, make sure to stay till 8pm to watch the parade and the fireworks! It was truly magical!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
499927245,5,2016-8,India,This was our first  Disneyland  experience. My 5 year son enjoyed every bit of it but was exhausted by the end of day because of his over excited parents behaving like kids and doing ride hopping without a break. For all of us this was the first visit to Disney and we wanted to cover each and every attraction. By the end of first day we realised that there is just too much to see in just one visit even with a 2 full day park access. However we had a ball of a time and this visit motivated us to visit the disneyland in paris a year later,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I will say it is brutally hot and humid in HK but while there were lines, there are also lots of shade and fans to add some relief.

"499017677,5,2017-6,India,""In Hong Kong, we eagerly awaited for the most sought after tour of Disneyland, the true fantasy filled wonderland, the Fantasyland! Little far from the city, our tour operator organised our transfer, and after nearly an hour   s drive from North Point, we were at the gates of the Disneyland by 10.30 am. Here again, it started to rain heavily as soon as we arrived, but thankfully rains were always in short spells, which allowed everyone to enjoy the Disneyland to the fullest. Everyone out here are so used to such intermittent rains that they are always ready with Umbrellas and rainwear. Inside Disneyland, the rides, shows, theatre, trains are all spectacular. The beautifully designed Castle, which is the universally famous and most prominent and recognised mark of Disneyland and people identify with, appears like a dream sequence, very warmly welcomes you inside the Disneyland. The fantasyland is vast and expansive and is always brimming with visitors, all through the year. But despite such heavy deluge of visitors   the infrastructure, queue systems, the facilities, the layout, the flow of everything is so well managed   that never once anyone bumps on to or rubs shoulder with any other person! Access to every ride and entertainment shows are super quick, hassle free and easily accessible. Once inside, you are on your own and free to chose your rides and shows of your liking and interest. The most interesting ones, which I checked out myself, were Tomorrow Land, Mystic Manor, Jungle River Cruise, Rail Road, Big Grizzly Mountain, Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man Experience, RC Racer, Mickey   s Wondrous Book and The Donald Duck 3D Animation Movie Show were simply superb and a must to experience. Among these, the experience of Hyperspace, Mystic Manor and Iron Man deserve applause in particular. All the above rides and events are full of thrills, frills, super exciting and mystical, which will not only challenge your fears and imagination but also give you an out of the world adrenaline rush and adventure moments to cherish, forever. It   s a huge place. Also housing a glittering shopping arcade, selling all kinds of Disneyland memorabilia, chocolates, apparels, decors, toys, and much more! But, all very pricey!And, it   s not over yet! As the clock strikes 8pm, the grand and glittering Disney parade troupe starts to appear, one by one, passing through the winding streets right in front of the open area outside Castle facade, virtually turning into an arena, with all the visitors collecting over and coming together from all parts of the fantasyland, to witness the spectacularly eclectic and glowing mix of dance and music. After almost an hour of this truly an awestruck dazzling show, the announcement is made for the 15 minutes of the firework show, starting at 8.45pm. This firework show in the backdrop of the glorious Castle, bathing in colourful lights, generates the maximum frenzy and interest among all the visitors   the last grandest of the grand show     is the icing on the cake before curtains are down for the day and everyone goes back in happiness beholding the cheerful memories, etched forever! And, finally the ultimate moment wrapped for the last comes alive"; there goes the non stop blitzkrieg of exotic fireworks: extreme, impressive, extravagant, spectacular and an amazingly colourful;" much like living a dream, joy and ecstasy writ large on everyone   s smiling faces. Finally, the razzmatazz of Disneyland tour of the real fantasyland comes to a fabulous end. I return back: all amazed, dazzled and delighted.(c) Anil Bishtanilbisht@rediffmail.com"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;
"499009304,4,2017-6,Singapore,""It was level 3 Typhoon warning when I went there in the morning. The staff informed us that outdoor rides close and ask we wanted to come back another day. They told us no idea when they will open. But since our itinerary was all planned, we decided to go in. After few hours, warning level escalate to 8 and we were inform Park has to close. It wasn't chaotic at all. People still strolling and looking around. Staff did I not really physically chase customer out. We quickly redeem our meal voucher and make our way out. Along the way we asked the staff and was told to keep the tickets as we can come back within 6 months with the same ticket. And so we did, on the next day afternoon, as the Typhoon came and left within a night. It was a good decision by my wife as the park is almost empty. We get to sit most of the rides without queue.

"498730139,5,2017-7,Australia,""This is our second trip to the park and we were very happy with our entire time. The only shame was the 1.5hrs of rain we had but this is July in Hong Kong so expect some rain. The experience entering the park was quick and painless. We decided to go us on rides and shows as it was our son's fourth birthday today. We never waited more than 20 minutes for any rides and that was refreshing not to have to line up for hours and most of the rides feature air conditioned lines. That feature is welcome as it was 29 degrees Celsius when it was not raining. The Ironman experience is a star tours ride along with Jarvis and Ironman himself. It is a good ride and the ride features a lot of Stark tech while you wait in the line. Hyperspace mountain is a great ride and after riding the hyperspace in Anaheim Disneyland this year I have to say this one is a better experience the visuals of the space battle are brighter and more defined. Mystic manor is a great ride too. It really does bring out some Disney magic using robotic cars. The only new show was Storybook theater and that was a good show with great singing dancing, sets and special effects. Food and shopping are usual for Disney parks and we bought the 3 in 1 food pass. Lunch combo and dinner combo meals with a free ice pop or caramel corn and discount on a bottled drink. Works out in your favour. You can book these on the Hong Kong Disney website under dining.We ride Hyperspace and Ironman twice, saw 3 shows and did quite a few other rides, saw the night parade and fireworks by 9:30pm. They say this park is small but honestly I was more than happy with the size and rides experiences available and never felt bored or annoyed with lineups. Oh and my son got his birthday badge from city hall. The cast members really made him feel special all day. We will definitely be visiting again."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"498693311,5,2017-3,New Zealand,""My friend and I recently spent 2 days in Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) and we loved it! The whole experience started with taking the train to HKD   really loved the whole Disneyland theme throughout the train, with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and cool golden statues of well loved Disney characters throughout the train. Even the train station carried through the magical theme.Loved the rides   my all time favourite was the  It's a small world  ride where you go on a boat ride through these amazing landscapes filled with singing and dancing dolls dressed in costumes from all over the world. Don't miss the parade of singing dolls that come through the clock face right in front of the ride (I think every hour on the hour). The song does stick in your mind after a while though :)There were so many magical rides, including the Dumbo ride which made you feel like you were flying, and the Mystic Manor ride with some pretty cool special effects. Don't miss the jungle boat ride as well. For the more adventurous people, they also had the more hairy rollercoaster ride, which was fun, with everyone screaming together! :) There was a bit of a wait for some of the more popular rides, but they weren't too long. Make sure you do bring along a bottle of water and a hat (or umbrella) though. I also really loved the Storybook Theatre and the Lion King show. These were like Broadway Musicals with all your well loved Disney friends. Superb shows with lots of singing, dancing and special effects which I really enjoyed. Really enjoyed the daily parade down Main Street, the night time parade as well as the fireworks at the end of the evening!When you get hungry, there were plenty of places to eat. We had special desserts in the shape of Olaf from Frozen and there were Mickey Mouse shaped waffles etc. Not cheap, but guess to be expected.We initially thought 2 days might be a bit much, but I think you do need that extra day to fully enjoy all that HKD had to offer (not to mention that you might want to experience your favourite rides more than once). Also, be aware that some of the parades might not be carried out depending on the weather (e.g. the special nighttime parade was cancelled the 2nd night we were there due to rain).HKD was such an awesome experience that until today, just thinking of our jaunt there still brings a happy smile to my face :) Fantastic experience for both adults and kids alike."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"498667991,5,2016-8,United Kingdom,""The first thing we wanted to do was meet some star wars characters so went there first and only had to wait a few minutes for each of them.As we were also visiting Ocean park on our trip to Hong Kong we decided at the start of the day that we would only do a few rides and I'm glad we made that decision before hand as the queues were long, about 45mins each for the couple we did. We spent the rest of the day meeting Micky and minnie, who are in more than one location at a time which I thought was great. Micky had a dance with my 7 year old which absolutely made her holiday and mine. We also met Tinker bell and rapunzel. We rode the train, went shopping,had a river tour saw a wonderful show and watched 2 parades. The night time one was lovely. I know some people think this is a small park but I thought it was so much better for being small, I personally had a much nicer time than at Florida Disney. I also found the metro really easy to use so getting to and from the park was really simple. if going in the hot season remember your umbrella for a bit of shade."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I've never been able to watch a Disney parade or fireworks show and still maintain personal space like I did here. It was so nice to not have to rush to shows or attractions. There aren't as many rides as the American parks. But it does have a Star Wars version of Space Mountain and the Mystic Manor, a creative alternative to the Haunted Mansion.

Best time of year to visit would definitely be in the fall or winter and not the hot summer. I would suggest paying extra to get the fast pass at certain rides.

We were a little spoiled by having visited Disney World in Orlando quite a few times, but it was still really fun to find Disney spreading joy in Asia! It was hot, but the people of Hong Kong were so nice and gracious, this is the quality was there in the rides, food, and entertainment. Definitely worth your time! Price quite a bit lower than Disney World too."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
497315135,5,2017-6,India,This place is just magical. Must see by tourists. It is quite compact compared to Ocean park. One can see everything provided one reaches Disneyland at 10:30 and then the parade starts at 8 pm. Fireworks at 9 pm.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"497042786,3,2017-6,Indonesia,""Visit on 25 June 2017 with my family. It is not public holiday in Hongkong, but the place was still crowded. I suppose it filled with overseas tourist, especially from Indonesia, since there was long public holiday in Indonesia. My brother purchased the tickets from Singapore.The location of the park is on Lantau Island. Near the Hongkong International Airport. You need to depart on Sunny Bay station if you ride with MTR and then continue with the special line to Disneyland Hongkong.The first thing that I noticed that the station, the train was decorated with Disney Theme, which is kind of improving the holiday mood. And then when the train arrive at the Disneyland station, the MTR announcer say   Have a magical day Alongside the road to the main entrance, there were lamp with poster of Iron Man and other Marvel character. As you may know, that Marvel already been purchased by Disney, which is obviously a great advantage because now Disney can incorporate the Marvel character to their ride, which it makes the Disneyland cooler and help them to step a little bit from their kid intended ride persona. I arrived early at 8 O'clock After exchanging the booking confirmation with ticket, we queued to get the bag check. There was already queued even when the park has not yet opened. The weather is bad, with all of sudden the rain come. You should bring umbrella or raincoat. So after the bag check we queue at the front entrance. It is opened at 9 O'clock but the queue were already long. It is not really pleasant queue since the weather was really hot. There was ( which I thought a VIP family) who granted to gain early access to the park. And the family were being accompanied by some girl staff, and some Disney character and started to take photo at some landmark spot, while we still waiting before the gate open to the common people. And then the gate opened finally, but we still cannot get inside to the main area ( where are the rides located) It is opened at 9.30. I thought that is the strategy so the guest forced to roaming around first at the shops. Of course we will enter the shop since that's the only place that could prevent you from the dead from the heat. The park itself it is not too big. The rides mostly intended for kid, with no high level thrilled rides. There is no roller coaster with loop for example or with corkscrew. My favourite ride were Hyperloop coaster and Iron Man. The food here were expensive. For one plate of fried rice will cost you around 100 HKD. Despite off the portion was quite big ( enough even for 3 persons). The drink even more expensive. But they provided with free drinking water fountain in the front of every restroom.We did not finish all day in here since the weather is really bad. Hot and suddenly rain come. Even at the parade, there was a moderate raining. Overall this park is good for kid, since most of the ride were designed to accommodate kids. But if you are a thrilled seeker maybe you will be disappointed. But still this place is good for photography."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fantasyland has all the classic fairytale Disney themed characters like dumbo , sleeping beauty castle , Carousel etc. Jungle river cruise , Tarzan's tree house are interesting. Mystic manor , Winnie the pooh , Small World are cute rides for young kids. Adults older teenagers will like fast paced rides like mine cars , RC racer. The hyperspace mountain rollercoaster ride and ironman experience are not to be missed.  food and drink inside the park are expensive no doubt! The facilities are well maintained.

My baby fell asleep and I've requested if we could stay for a while after the session since any motion will wake her up & the heat outside was unbearable. The answer from the Disney staff was a flat no. So I had to leave with a tired baby in my arms & walk under the heat of the sun. I expected more compassion from Disney, being a family centered theme park.  Bland Chinese food from Maxim's (plus they charge for continents like soy sauce even if they serve dimsum)  Rude staff. I saw how a staff member was so rude to a certain race who was asking how much a drink cost. The staff got the price tag & slammed it in front of the customer.

"496106653,2,2017-6,United States,""Disney is synonymous of magic. I am not particular fond of theme parks or Disneyland, after taken my kids their, now adults, too many times. But I appreciate what the inheritors of Walt Disney vision have been able to achieve. No one can deny the global significance of Disney as a cultural symbol of American talent, creativity and command of the entertainment industry. As expected they have tried to translate that experience into a more local and regional  cultural dialect . That is why we have Disney parks in France, Tokyo, Hong Kong and so on. In the end when you visit those Disney parks in foreign lands you have a kind of split personality experience. You do not really know where you are and what you are watching. If you are from the USA or from a Western country, and traveling with your family, I strongly advise you to avoid Hong Kong Disneyland. Immerse your self in providing them with a real experience of a place that most probably they will not be visiting again soon. Taking them to Disney will just make them yearn for going back home and reduce their interest in experiencing the certainly much more confusing cultural landscape of this strange lands. Going to Disneyland is quick solution to keep the kids happy. But don't be fooled. It will replace the magic of discovery for the conventional and convenient magic they are used to.

The fast lane pass was given out at specific timings but I never got to queue for it. Average wait was about 10 15 mins. The food places were all generally crowded but with the expectations of crowd n queues, it was alright. Food was quite expensive but ok. I didn't stay at the Disney hotels so we took the MTR.

Adding to our disappointment is that the ticketing was not discounted and we were not made aware at the time we purchased the tickets that half the rides would not be operating.Regrettably, for fear of the ferries closing down we left early to return to Macau (apparently we were on the second last ferry to leave Hong Kong at 1530hrs that same afternoon) and so we did not get to experience the park in full, however, we shall definitely return next time we are in Hong Kong to experience Disneyland in full :)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The information from the cast member here may not be necessarily correct like that in the states: for example, I asked a cast member from PhilharMagic where does the evening parade start, and he told me it started from Main Street USA which was incorrect and totally the opposite. 4. Didn't see a lot of  Disney Scoop  and saw some trash during non parade fireworks time. 5. Saw several cast members using cell phone on stage.Other thoughts: overall the cast members' energy and smile are better than those from SHDR and more responsive in general, while SHDR focuses more on Disney Point and trash free environment. It's a bummer that there's no Downtown Disney in HK. Must dos if you're a cast member from the states: Iron Man Experience   a Star Tours like ride that is about Iron Man and Hong Kong, really unique and amazingMystic Manor   A slow moving ride that is similar to Haunted Mansion with a different story settingRC Racer   just do itFestival of Lion King   more singing and less dancing compared to the one in Animal Kingdom.

All of us were over 20 yo so we had targeted rides with height warnings such as Iron Man Experience, Grizzly Gulch, Speed Racer, and Hyperspace Mountain etc. Iron Man was the most disappointing of them all, as the '4DX' movie was too short, had an unimaginative storyline and was by far the worst disney ride. Hyperspace Mountain had been bought by Star Wars and its opening tune as we rode into pitch black was exciting and familiar. The ride was probably the best one and we went on it 3 times, but the lighting wasnt perhaps too bright and we could see some of the roller coaster's structure, which sort of ruined the  space illusion , unlike the one in Paris. Grizzly Gulch, an outdoor coaster, was also graced by our bums 3 times as well. To be fair, there was nothing wrong with the ride (it even had a surprise factor) however we were used to the likes of alton towers and our experienced and wise selves craved a higher thrill factor.

Luckily, they had an offer for two day entry at a marginally higher price. We were happy we took that offer. On weekdays, the crowds especially in the morning around 1030 hrs or so is not too much. However, if you book in advance, you can go straight to the turnstiles and get your passes. The rides and all the attractions that we visited were wonderful and well organized.

494465266,5,2017-5,South Africa,We have a toddler and we wernt sure if this would be a park for him... we where pleasantly surprised as he could do most of the rides.. just a fair warning look at the map as some rides seem ok for kids as you enter the ride.. height was our bench mark but one of the rides has an exclamation mark on the map that indicated not for kids... little did we know as we took our toddler on a haunted house ride as at the entrance it wasnt mentioned... Ouch   but we are partly to blame... ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"494409689,5,2017-6,United States,""It rained the first half of the day but lines were short all day!  The park was clean and the staff was amazing!!  We had 19 kids with us and had a blast. It's much smaller than the states, but you can get around quickly."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
494279895,4,2017-6,Indonesia,This was my second visit. The first one was in Feb 2007. The attractions are old IMHO. USS Singapore is better in my opinion.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
494262288,4,2017-6,Singapore,Lots of Disney characters and lots of shows for the kids. A bit disappointed as we were caught in the typhoon and the park was closed early. But the kids enjoyed the shows! It was great fun. The pooh ride as well as the Toy story ride was great fun for the kids!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"494235525,3,2017-6,Australia,""If you have small children then HK Disney is probably worth a visit, but if you have seen the LA and Orlando versions, then perhaps don't bother. HK Disney is just as slick, but it's about 1 4 of the size and the rides   attractions are limited. Cost is quite high. Entry is about $100 Australian Dollars ($75 USD) and food onsite is pricey too. I'm not sorry I went, sure I had fun but as an adult it was all over for me in less than 3 hours."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"494140952,5,2017-6,India,""Visiting Disney Land was the main reason why we decided to visit HK in the first place...and it didnt disappoint!.From Kowloon we traveled to Disney by the MRT. We realised one doesnt need organised tours at all. That way you can spend as much time at any part of Disney you cnhoose. You are not time bound.we decided to travel in June (altho very very HOT) as most of the holiday crowd wud be gone and we were right. We didnt have to wait too long in lines at any of the rides. The 4D theater is an experience by itself. The beautifully done up colorful Disney float parade in the evening brings about a carnival like experience that takes to to another zone in your mind. very enjoyable. we had a wonderful day at Disney....with so much to do there, we left at 5:30 in the evening!!! There are quite a few eateries restaurants. Would have been nicer if they werent so expensive. But i guess those are  disney prices ...Wonderful funfilled day, whether an adult or child, this ones a MUST DO in HK!! Enjoy!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493908534,4,2017-6,United States,""So I'm comparing this park to the one in California and it just doesn't come close. It is so much smaller and just doesn't have many rides. It's pretty and definitely clean but just lacking in attractions. I'm not sure if they plan on adding more, the park is not new. We went to Ocean Park a couple of years ago and that was much more fun. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493892532,5,2017-5,India,""This is a place which takes you to a magical journey into the world of Disney Characters! Both adults and kids have ample opportunity to enjoy.Few essentials to remember while planning your trip:1. If you are a first time visitor, especially with kids, plan for 2 days and 1 night. This will be comfortable itinerary to exlpore the park at leisure, without rushing through the attractions2. Plan overnight stay at one of the 3 Disney hotels near the Park, since the park is an hour to 90 minutes away from central island or Kowloon and it can be tiring journey back in the night3. Take a 2 day pass at discounted rates4. Not too many vegetarian options in the park. Carry your own supplies if you canFirst and foremost, there are 2 parades in the park , one at 1:30 pm and the other at 7:30 pm followed by night firework display. Both are not to be missed! Try to reach the central parade venue 30 minutes before parade timings to get a vanatge view.The enitre park is divided into 7 zones as follows:a) Toy story Land   rides for adults and kids. Parachute Drop and RC racer are more exciting than the othersb) Mystic Point   Mystic Manor is nice journey in an old Manor on a electro magnetic cartc) Grizzly Gulch   Mine Train is exciting and Geyser Gulch in uniqued) Adventureland   Don't miss the absolutely amazing Lion King Show and kid friendly Jungle River Cruise. Kids will enjoy Tarzan's Treehousee) Fantasyland   Has some wonderful shows which the entire family can enjoy.  It's a small World ,  Mickey Philarmagic ,  Mickey and the Wonderous Book ,  Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh  are simply wonderfulf) Tomorrowland   Futuristic Rides, especially for older kids and adults.  Hyperspace Mountain  is one of the best rides not to be missed. Also try  Orbitron  and  Buzz Year Astroblasters  for fung) Main USA Street   Nothing much to see except an animation theatre and shopsAbove are based on our experience and not a guide.Enjoy your visit"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
493878486,5,2017-2,China,Our stay and time in the park was great. It admittedly had the  Disney Prices  but what can you expect from the Mouse and his friends? The food was very good in the Hotel and the Park. All of the staff was very helpful and everyone we encountered spoke English. The Little Woman and I are thinking of ditching the kids and heading back this summer.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
493763234,4,2017-5,India,Although the overall area is not as big as some other disney land parks but I would still recommend to take the 2 day ticket specially if you want to cover all the attractions shows and also take pics with the characters. Would recommend to download the disneyland app so that you are updated on the show timings and the availability of characters in different areas at different times. Ofcourse do not miss the light and fire crackers show at the end of the day. Almost all the restaurants offer atleast 1 meal   menu option in vegetarian. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493718326,5,2016-12,Philippines,""Hong Kong experience will never be complete without visiting Disneyland, especially if it's your first time in HK. The attraction has various rides that caters to all ages although some rides are not for the faint of heart (talk about wasting an hour to sleep due to nausea :( ) Nevertheless, Disneyland evoked a lot of happy memories of my childhood. Be sure not to miss the fireworks before the park closes. It's a must see!!! The fireworks show is enough to make all spectators go  wooooooow  in unison!It would be best to visit in the morning so you will have the entire day to explore the attractions. Just make sure you bring your own ponchos (raincoat) just in case it rains. I tell you, the park sells it at a ridiculous price. About the food, it is also pricey. I recommend you allot at least HKD120 to be on the safe side."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493499894,4,2017-6,South Korea,""We have an 8 year old who would find a lot of the rides a bit boring. We focused on the rides with  big drops  (see HK DLand website)    Grizzly, Hyperspace, RC Racer, and Iron Man    and they were all fun rides. We rode the Grizzly 5 times, as the wait was less than 5 minutes (lucky considering it was a Sunday afternoon?). We also rode the Toy Soldier Parachute drop, which was fun, but way too short (less than 60 seconds) considering the long wait (25 minutes). There are 2 parades everyday    one at 3pm and one at 7:30pm. They are different, and both are fun to watch.Two things I would recommend everyone do. One, get the HK Disneyland app on your smartphone. It shows the wait time on each ride, so it helps planning on which ride to go to next. Two, eat before or after your visit, and bring a big bottle of water. I did not think the food was that great, and things are pricey inside the park."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493448221,3,2017-5,United Kingdom,""I have no doubt it would have been great if we had weather hadnt been so bad. Everything was rained off including the parades. Dont waste your time or money if the weather is bad.Also, the place isnt that big so do not go at 9am because there wont be enough to do until the shows at 8pm. Would recommend going around 2pm."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493284550,5,2016-7,Philippines,""My first time in Hong Kong, I wasnt able to enter Disney it was in 2011 with my sister. The second time around I was with my husband in 2016, and that time we went inside Disneyland. We were both in awe. Its truly magical. We were like living in our childhood dreams. It was my husband's birthday, and good timing the 10th anniversary of Disneyland Hongkong. I would never forget the fun we had, and the happiness we shared. And most especially the look in my husband's face when he witness the fireworks. His captivated and almost in tears. He said coming to Disneyland was the best birthday he ever had and still is."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493175519,5,2017-6,Philippines,""As expected, disney has full of excitement but during our visit, it was very hot. I would suggest that if you intend to visit during month of June, bring at least 2 extra shirts, fan, towel and lots of bottled water. The resto inside is very expensive, better eat in their messhall, more choices of food and 20% cheaper than in a specialty resto. After lunch visit till closing is the best time to go there."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
493149219,5,2017-6,Australia,We spent our daughters 14th birthday here! The parade at 3.30pm was wonderful! We went on rides and there was plenty to see and do,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493147146,2,2016-11,Italy,""In Hong Kong the whole park revolves around disney merchandising.You'll find an endless serie of similar shops selling all sort of toys and (mostly useless) gimmicks.The rollercoasters seem to target far younger crowds than else in the world, or better, they are family focused, with exhausted adults wearing disney outfits enduring infinite lines with children on tail. Even if I have nothing against it, I was expecting some more excitement for millennials and grown up kids, like you can find in Tokyo for example.Surely a missed opportunity."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"493022818,5,2017-6,India,""One of the most beautiful experiences of Hong Kong visit, Disneyland is a must visit. It should not be missed as it has something for everyone. A good idea is to take the train ride of the park first as it gives an overall perspective of the park.Comfy shoes are a must. Also do carry water bottles as the ones sold in the park are very expensive. Take five minutes to plan your visit around the park with the help of the map. (You could visit the website and check out the rides and the areas that thrill you the most)It may be the a smaller Disneyland when compared to Florida, but the positive is you can finish it completely in one day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
492895842,4,2017-5,Philippines,My 2nd time in Disney HK. The new attraction Iron Man Experience fell short of my expectations. I don't know but the ride not excite me enough. There were not a lot of people when we went so lines are shorter. We watched 2 parades the one around lunch and the one in the afternoon. Both parades are short now. I think I remember the parades before were longer. We did not stay for the fireworks and evening parade. There were not a lot of character sightings also for picture taking. The only character we were able to take pictures with are BB8 and Chewbacca. We did not see the other characters. I still love Disney despite all this. Just wish that they could make the characters come out more for picture taking since there are a lot of Disney characters anyway so they can just rotate. I would have loved to meet the characters again. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"492884905,5,2017-6,Australia,""Of course we enjoyed Disneyland. You don't have to be a kid! From the themed train ride from the MTR at Sunny Bay ( a must) and the grand entrance of wide streets, gardens fountain etc, to the park itself, it's just a fun day. It is more kid orientated, a much smaller park than most, less adult roller coaster rides, but who doesn't like going to Disneyland. It's a small world ride still a lovely entertaining experience, though it takes hours to get the song out of your head. As usual always spotlessly clean! Only time we saw the real Disney characters were in the main entrance area, think maybe more Mickey Minnie etc appearances could be made. Tip, avoid the weekend if possible. And be aware, u line up for the Disney train in the park, but they only let u go one stop. We expected to be able to do a circuit, after waiting so long. But came away with ears with our name on it..... so we happy! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
492687726,5,2017-1,Thailand,We've stayed in Disneyland Hong Kong Resort therefore it's very near to this park. The area is smaller from the park in other countries but very convenient and suitable for a day trip which you don't need to spend a lot of time for walking between each theme stations. We've stayed for the whole day until evening.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"492677869,5,2017-6,Philippines,""Truly the happiest place on earth! Best time to arrive during the opening hours to be able to breeze through queues on attractions and rides.

492608247,5,2017-5,Australia,We made a last minute decision to visit HK Disneyland and am very glad we did. It's much smaller than Disneyland and Disney World but absolutely beautiful in its own way.

"492334787,5,2017-6,Philippines,""Absolutely wonderful experience at Disney Land in Hong Kong. My one piece of advice is drink lots of water and bring a change of clothes for the kids and yourself because it's quite a journey to get to Disney Land and it's humid so you go from sweating and wet to aircon in the taxi, bus or train... Enjoy xx "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"492205229,4,2017-5,Singapore,""We are a group of 5, 3 adults and 2 kids. Stayed at Kingdom Club. Wonderful service by staff in most places in its Hotel and Park. Dining with Characters was an organised one as the staff made sure Mickey, Minne, Pluto and Goofy visited every table. Well done for this. Kingdom Club was good for those with high budget, for 3 days 2 nights was about SGD4000. Room wise, except for 30 over bed bites on my legs and my sister's legs in Disneyland hotel bed near to the curtain, overall furnishings were quite old. Facilities were alright since most of the time, we were at the Park. We made two leisure walks from Disneyland back to hotel, time was about 15mins, we liked it and would do that again. Park experience, overall good except a few grumbling young ladies who were selling the ice cream and popcorns etc mobile booth outside TomorrowLand, probably due to hot weather. They shouted at the customers to queue up when there was no queue line in sight unlike other mobile booths. Waits for rides were about 45mins to 80mins. We had fast pass so not too bad for us.

492171924,4,2017-6,Guam,June is HOT HOT HOT so dress for the heat and humidity. Be sure to take lots of sunscreen and a hat. Toy Story has no shade so take the little ones there early otherwise it's just too hot in the summer! The park is well laid out and most of the staff speak English. The light parade and fireworks are great so be sure to stay and enjoy them. We spent 10 hours there and only saw 4 characters which was very disappointing. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"492170334,5,2017-6,United States,""According to 2 hour's research, Klook is as cheap as tickets get. Used Klook for meal passes too, which was a bargain (but one meal for 6 was STILL US$80!! And the food at Tomorrowland was the worst we've had anywhere in Southeast Asia). But, we had fun and blowing some US$450 in a day did fulfill the kids' wishes. They really did enjoy it, and so did we. Disney really should keep all attractions open till closing";" it's very frustrating (and rip offy) to close some things a couple hours early. Iron Man was the best attraction, though Hyperspace Mountain was a kick. What most surprised me was what I didn't see: no one was going potty in the water fountain, no one was blowing smoke in kids' faces, no one was pushing or shoving, despite the many TripAdvisor reviews describing such atrocities. To the contrary, people were calm and considerate! Maybe it was because we went on a weekday."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

492084456,2,2017-5,India,This is surely an over hyped place. The area is very small if you compare with other places. Rides are very few (especially for those who are  12 years) and place is more of a selling Disney merchandise than a theme park.

"491962350,5,2017-6,India,""This place is vast....the emphasis being on vast. It's divided into various sections. You can easily take the information map near the entrance counter and proceed accordingly. It is very well laid out and the rides and shows a great fun. However, it is extremely expensive and a water bottle costs somewhere between 25   30 HKD .You can easily eat an Indian combo meal at the Explorers club restaurant . Disneyland is well maintained and a must visit for the families. The night time parade is an absolute treat to watch .We got a chance to view the afternoon parade too. This too was great fun.

"491260639,4,2017-6,Singapore,""Based on other travellers' reviews, there are several things I can affirm. The meal coupons are really cost saving. The wait for the rides in June was short as there weren't very much visitors. BUT the heat can easily cause sun burn. There isn't very much cooling places to escape from, not very much seating for the elderly. You MUST look out for water coolers to refill your bottles.

"491148030,5,2017-4,Australia,""We spent two days at Disney due to the age of our children but one days would probably be enough if you didnt have kids. Disney is just about perfect and they have thought of everything to ensure your visit is memorable and fun. The rides were all great, the staff were friendly and accomodating.

I   m not saying it would be like that on the weekend nor would I even want to try but for our visit the lines were amazingly short";" 5 10 minute line for each ride.

Iron Man ride was good (but Transformers @ Universal Studio was way much better). Staffs were friendly. Fireworks at the end is a must see. Not enough feature of Elsa & Anna despite Frozen being one of the more successful animation in recent times. Variety of Disney characters rather limited. Maybe due to the summer heat wave.

"490002960,5,2017-6,Singapore,""It's one of the best attractions of Hong Kong that requires you to spend at least the entire day there. The experience begins as soon as you reach Sunny Bay MTR. The train to Disneyland is fitted with everything iconic about Disney, including the windows!The entire theme park is super clean and it opens as early at 10am as a preview. The rides cater to both adults and children. Spend time and explore. The new ride for Ironman is superb, though the StarWars attraction was a little under developed for such a rich franchise. One thing to note for adults is the lack of coffee throughout the theme park. Lunchtime crowds can be very challenging on your patience. End your day at the souvenir shops and not at the beginning. Else you will have to lug all your gifts on gravity defying rides. Stay for the parade that starts at 8pm and only leave after the nightly fireworks. It's worth it all!

We manage to ride almost everything that day compare when we first came here. We decided to go mid week to avoid congestion of tourist and that was a good decision.

"489947340,4,2017-1,Finland,""Disneyland is cute and exiting for kids with it's theme which is visible anywhere you look, but the only thing is that their height limits are kinda high compared to Universal studios in Singapore for example. Our 3 year old daughter who loves fast rollercoasters, didn't get to go on a single one, because she was 104 cm when the minimum height was more to some attractions. But she only complained for a minute and enjoyed every second in the other attractions for smaller kids, since they were so good and beautiful made. We saw a 30 minute musical about Lion king which was wonderful, and just a perfect little time for a 3 year old to hang on to. In the evening when Disneyland closed, a firework began behind the Disney castle. I was very impressed myself even if I'm 28 years old. That was definitely everything but a fiasco. The disney stores in the theme park are very crowded before closing so make sure you buy your souvenirs during the day time to avoid long lines. We went to Ocean park too. If you can't deside eather you should go to disneyland or ocean park, we definitely recommend disneyland. It's better, even for adults and I'm not a huge disney fan or anything.

We did not wait longer than that for every ride, so we were able to go on all the large rides in a morning!

"488612724,4,2017-5,United Kingdom,""I was interested to see how Hong Kong Disneyland compared with the parks in Orlando and Paris. I wasn't disappointed. I visited on a Thursday as having read many reviews I wanted to avoid the weekend when more local guests visit. I also opted for a Disney Dining package to cut down on costs. Travelled to the park using MTR from Hong Kong via Sunny Bay. Ordered tickets online and picked up at  Magic  collection booths to avoid queues. First off it's small, compared to WDW in Orlando it's tiny and even compared to Paris it's small. That said everything is really accessible, you can criss cross the park easily and I would say 1 day is more than enough to take in the major attractions and shows. If you do have small ones then maybe 2 days would be needed as it can get hot and the queues tend to be for the Fantasy land rides of which only the Winnie the Pooh ride has FastPass.Whilst I was there many of the food outlets were closed so I was restricted using my food vouchers, however there were 4 5 places I could use them. The food options are varied with both Western and Oriental options. Prices vary from HK$95 for a burger combo to HK$159 for a mixed grill combo. There are side dishes available too for uner HK$50.Main Street was crowded at the 10:30am rope drop as the Main Street is smaller than other parks but guests dispersed quickly and after heading straight to Tomorrowland there were no queues for Hyperspace Mountain   I rode 3 times without having to queue.Some areas open and close at different times   Grizzly Gulch opened at 11 and closed at 19:45   I'm assuming for  crowd  management and maintenance. Throughout the day I was able to re ride a few times on the main roller coasters without queueing   longest wait was 15 minutes on Runaway Mine Cars due to a hardware glitch.Many of the rides are similar to the US and Paris versions but with subtle differences. Space Mountain is tamer than Paris but racier than Orlando   no inversionsRunaway Mine Cars   has cool reverse section like Everest in Animal KingdomMystic Manor   Haunted Mansion 2.0  serious upgrade.Ironman Experience   Star Tours rebrand.Only 3 FastPass rides Hyperspace Mountain, IronMan experience and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   nothing over in Grizzly Gulch or Toy Story Land.Lots of rides have indoor sections so you aren't outside in the heat and humidity all day.Park was kept clean and tidy with no obvious signs of litter.All in all a great value day out."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is also where you will see the schedule of shows. For those who doesnt understand Chinese, fall in line on the attractions with English guides. The fireworks are to die for, I dont know but it gives us goosebumps...maybe bec it brings out childhood memories in us.

The food's not bad and we enjoyed sitting outdoor where we found very comfortable.Recommend to spend two days on weekdays. After that, you can go to nearby Tung Chung MTR station for shopping and dining. If time allowed, go to take the cable car in Tung Chung as well.

"486709625,4,2017-4,Philippines,""No matter how old or young you are, Disneyland is a place to be. Hongkong Disneyland is far from the city, but transportation is not a problem. They have their own Disney train, complete with Mickey Mouse windows, that you can ride from Sunny Bay station going to Disneyland. If you are staying in HongKong central or Tsim Sha Tsui, it is a one hour ride and you have transfer trains. Before you enter the main gate to Disneyland Theme Park, there is a luggage storage area at the side so you could leave your things though I'm not sure if it's free. You can also but food for a much cheaper price outside, and of course, eat it there before going in. We availed our ticket from the host of our hostel and got it for a cheaper price and we were able to skip the long ticketing lines.Once you got in, you may get the map and attraction schedules on the side. This will help you decide where to go first and what time are the shows and parades. We went there on a Friday so the line wasn't long. Toy Story attractions are more about rides and I suggest you visit that place first. There are restaurants inside Disneyland and they are expensive. About HK$130 for a full meal. But we got a discount coupon from the airport (Go to the tourism board booth) and we got 20% off on the meal we bought. The servings were big and good enough for 2 so you can share. The best place to watch the parade is on Main Street USA, beside the cafe. Check the schedule of the parade. When we went there last April, we watched the production of Lion King and it was really great. Don't miss out on watching these shows. Staff inside Disneyland give out stickers for free. If they don't give you one, you can ask them. The stickers are good souvenir and it's free! You can also ask them to take your pictures. Walking around Disneyland is tiring so don't forget to bring water and wear comfy shoes. For those who are wondering, it's HK$50 for a mickey mouse or ironman waffle. The ice cream is for HK$30.Don't forget to watch the fireworks display!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There were cool differences from California and Florida   both in the smaller size and in some of the Asian sensibilities: a really cool Mystic Manor replaced the Haunted Mansion (loved it), a Toy Story land is a heaven of huge toys (and a deceptively fun Hot Wheels roller coaster), and the Star Wars upgrade to Space Mountain ROCKED. Otherwise, you may see more gardens, eat some squid, miss Pirates of the Caribbean, and see more precision in the Asian section of Small World.

"485814929,5,2017-5,India,""Sharing some tips for a family visit 1) If you are visiting Disneyland for the first time, better is to buy two days tickets as weather can change anytime. So if you have two days tickets you can use the second day ticket in case it rains   you face long queue. 2) Try buying tickets from deals site, do a google search 3) For senior citizen tickets buy directly from Disneyland site. 4)No food is allowed inside, and whatever is available inside is expensive  may not be to your test. But you can make sure to reach early around 9.30. Carry some dry food , have it in nice sitting area before micky water fountain. 5) They have meal deal which needs to be purchased before entry. Buy this only if you are ready to order the most expensive meal option ( mostly with beaf) to get true discount. If you are a veg person you are better buying an individual items than meal coupon."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"485785374,4,2017-5,Philippines,""The place is really small and cozy. I think its great for toddlers that have just started to learn how to run. The place is small enough to catch them quick. Going on a weekday like we did also lessens the chance of losing your little one. Rides are almost all toddler friendly. My son had a blast! Although he only went on a few rides because he's an impatient little boy, he still had loads of fun running around the place. Food is quite expensive, since, my wife, son and I were really hungry we probably spent over HKD600 for lunch and snacks. But still we got to take home a really nice Mickey Mouse shaped lunchbox. All in all, we had a great time there. Everything is convenient. We brought our on stroller, but the place has strollers and wheelchairs for rent. Walking is a breeze. It's pretty much flat with little elevated areas making walking less tiring. Great place to bring the little ones. I feel like it's a prerequisite for the bigger theme parks as my son grows up."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"485574414,5,2016-7,Australia,""We stayed at Disneyland Hollywood Hotel and quickly got a shuttle to Disneyland. We had pre purchased 2 day tickets which I recommend and got in quickly at opening time. We stayed till the parade, went back to the resort and rested for a few hours before returning to see the light parade which is a must!! It was also a lot quitter at night and we had several goes on many of the rides that had long queues during the day. Having a 2 day pass allowed us to take our time and enjoy the sights at Disney and not spend all our time waiting in lines. It's a great size and almost identical to Disneyland in California.

With still around 7 hours to go, we did the park at ease and did the more  adult  rides. I'd say you could do this park in about 4 5 hours. We stayed till the fireworks, which is something you just have to see when you're at Disneyland. I'd recommend to look at the fireworks from the shopping street as you can leave immediately afterwards and you're not caught in the mass of people.I think it's nice the trains are personalised to Disney figures. Good connection as there's a special Disneyland stop. I enjoy they really try to suck you in the magical atmosphere they have. As expected the food is quite expensive here, so we didn't eat here.

"485298868,5,2017-4,Qatar,""I loved this Disneyland. After being to Paris and Disney World, this was a breath of fresh air (sometimes a little bit hot air) This park is set in the most beautiful back drop. It is like they have taken a chuck of a mountain out and placed a Beautiful Disney park. The castle from a distance with the green Valleys in the back ground and it not being the busiest of parks is is picture perfect. It Has a very cool chilled vibe to this park, never a rush to get everywhere just a nice little walk through green plants, trees and water mist spots.My two girls (6 &4 Years old) were able to get most of the rides apart from two but while my 6year old and her dad went on the Grizzle bear , me and the youngest played next to the blowholes that got you wet (good way to cool down if it's hot) the food in the park was delicious I don't think we had a bad meal. I didn't feel that it was so expensive for the food or the merchandise. We didn't get to meet the princesses due to the face we kept missing them but we get get a little wave from Tinkerbell, which made the girls happy. The shows are wonderful and a must.. the best rides for us was the Grizzle bear mine train and the Mystic manor. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

And whenever we have friends coming with their kids we always love to meet there and we love our Instagram meetUp with HK followers or even overseas one, it's Truly magical. They do a good job of outlining where and at what time the characters will be out greeting. Characters commonly sign autograph books, which you can buy in the Emporium on Main Street.

Throughout our visit, NOT A SINGLE cast member wished me a Happy Birthday (I was quite hurt). The cast members all looked like they've been owed their wages and did not look like they were working at the most magical place on earth. It wasn't even a particularly busy day because it had rained in the morning, so we could only go in at almost noon ish. The only up side was the queues were relatively short, but that's about it. Don't think it's worth spending close to a $100 (SGD) here. Will probably be my last visit. I'd rather save more money and go to Tokyo Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"482495488,4,2017-5,United States,""Have visited Disney parks in California and Florida, and recently had the opportunity to visit their park in Hong Kong. Getting here was very easy. The MTR provides Disney park with its own line. You can get to the park from pretty much anywhere the MTR services Hong Kong. We made our visit on a Tuesday ( May 2nd). Arrived there just minutes before the park opened (10:30am). Pleasantly surprised with the small crowd. The park entrance is very wide and clean. Landscaping is traditional Disney. As you pass the entrance (the main train station ) and walk into  Main Street, USA  you will understand why I chose the title   it's a small world after all . Had I done some research prior to coming I would have not been surprised by how small this park really is. It's nearly one fifth the size of Magic Kingdom in Florida. Aside from the small scale , the park is very much  Disney . Tarzan's tree house was closed for maintenance. This has a big impact considering the few attractions in the park. For the roller coaster enthusiasts , I recommend the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. I won't give it away just suffice it to say there are surprising maneuvers. Over all a fun park despite its small size ( you can easily cover the entire park at a leisurely walk in less than 5 hrs, just my opinion). Expect hefty prices for any and all goods you purchase in the park. Most park employees speak English enough to communicate with you. We were pleased to find most employees had left the Honk Kong attitude at the gate. Get a bench early (6 6:30pm) in front of the castle for a good view of the fireworks. Park closes promptly after the pyrotechnics (8:00pm). There are plenty of trains to take you back to your destination so no need to worry. Overall a pleasant experience , but the size of the park was disappointing. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"482317447,4,2017-5,Canada,""Smaller than Anaheim park and is like a minipark compared to Orlando. Easy to navigate and shorter distance between attractions. They have multiple languages to suit the needs of the customers. There are rides that are different than the US parks. Expensive because the entrance fee is just slightly lower than the US park.

Heat was incredible on Wednesday   saw two different people require medical attention due to queuing in the sun. Waited to see Mickey for nearly an hour and gave up as there were still at least 50 people in front of us (even though we were told it would take one hour when we joined the queue, that was also in full sun). The queues for photos with the characters were full of adults and no consideration was given at all to families with kids. I know everyone pays to get in, but does every adult really need a professional photo with Mickey and Minnie and then take another 10  posed photos with their own camera?!?!?! Time limits need to be set, ie each  group  (and not each individual) has xx time with the characters so the queue actually moves.Got the MTR to Disneyland from Kowloon   easy but busy.Food choices available and prices ok (paid about AU$60 for four people at the Tomorrowland dinner   burgers etc).

We had to buy new tickets again in Disneyland but the bank reimbursed the money about 2 weeks later. So just to save yourself from this headache just buy the tickets at the hotel you're staying.

The park has some great rides like Hyperspace Mountain to the amazing Grizzly Gulch Ride. We loved watching all the parades especially the flights of fantasy parade to the amazing paint the night parade now that is something you really have to see! Its one of the most amazing night time Disney parades i have seen. There was a bit of a queue to meet the characters but its like that in every park. I have to say that the food here is incredible!

"481283383,4,2017-4,United States,""We visited HK Disneyland during the week of Easter and Good Friday. It was not as busy as most locals had travelled outside of HK. The wait for the rides was not long at all. Our average wait was 20 minutes. The staff there was nice. I have to say that the food at the park is very expensive. Overall, it was better than the first time I had been there since my 7 year old son came with me this time around."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"481189227,5,2017-5,United States,""I'm a Disney kid who grew up into an adult who still loves escaping into fantasy and have visited most disney parks around the world. Disney HK is worth the trip. Mystic Manor is Imagineering in top form. The park layout makes it easy to enjoy in less than a day but I'm sure you could spend longer. Shuttle service to the Disney hotels made everything really convenient. Unfortunately I had a bad experience on opening day of the new Explorers Lodge but I trust Disney will fix issues  I just felt harrased and as if the magic of a Disneyland was stolen from me. Either way, Disneyland HK was super fun  I recommend checking out some of the products you can only get in the gift shops  I picked up an awesome Star Wars limited edition collectible and was just really caught up in the Disney magic until I left and went back to the lodge. Definitely go to Disney HK. My friends had just gone and also recommended downloading the app to help navigate and get useful tips. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
481127923,2,2017-4,Australia,Will not be going back. Very expensive and you queue for an hour for a 2 minute ride. The rides are great once you get on but the queues are just too long.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"481116136,5,2017-4,United Kingdom,""This was our first Disneyland experience & it was magical!It was raining but this did not matter. We took out the rain jackets, bought an umbrella & went on. Most of the rides are indoors so this did not have much of an impact. But there are a few outside which seem to keep going in the rain. I decided to brave the rain for a few of them and ended up a bit wet, but went to watch Lion King afterwards & dried out a little. The show was fantastic & has us singing Hakuna Matata. Unfortunately the rain did not stop in time for the night time parade & sadly it was cancelled. It did stop for the fireworks & this made our day. The park is a bit on a the expensive side and some of the attractions were closed due to maintenance. Other than that there was little to complain about."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"481108330,5,2017-5,South Africa,""My wife and I visited Disney World Hong Kong for a day. We were unsure of what to expect since we got mixed reviews from Trip Advisor and people who have visited before.We have not been to any other Disney World before and understand that the Hong Kong park is the smallest one.On arrival, you can feel the excitement of parents who are trying to fulfil their little ones dreams. The kids are in absolute over drive mode from the time they get there.Disney does very well in creating a fun and vibrant atmosphere. This is how all customers are should be treated and proves to be a great customer service lesson for all companies. All the facilities are well kept, neat and clean including the rest rooms. When going on tides the waiting areas are designed to cool guests off mostly in shaded areas through either air conditioning and fans.The queues can be long for some of the popular shows and rides but are all worth the wait. Like I said even for adults the shows, showmanship, costumes, special effects are completely amazing.The not to miss shows include the Iron Man experience (more for adults and teens), Mickey's story book and the Lion King (especially for kids). There are other shows catering more the younger kids (ages 5   11) like mystic manor, pooh bear, etc. We went on all of these nonetheless as it gives you great reprieve from the humidity during the hottest parts of the day.There are a few small scale roller coasters and thrilling rides which we did not do as my wife does not have the stomach for it. For thrill seekers these appear to be good.Food and drinks in the park is quite expensive (HK $ 32 for a 500 ml coke) and there are many restaurants, hot dog stands and ice cream stands for snacks and bites and refreshing drinks.You are allowed to bring small snacks and cold drinks into the park and suggest you do so if you planning a full day there.The night parade at about 19h30 is worth the wait especially for the little ones and teens. We skipped the fireworks display which is on at 20h30 after having spent the whole day there from 11h00 but we have heard that it is quite spectacular.Also suggest that you do the train ride first when you enter the park as it provides perspective on what there is in the park and allows you to plan what to first if you not planning on staying the whole day.You could do the entire park in a full day depending on how may kids you have. If you just adults one day is enough.Enjoy!!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
481103955,3,2017-5,Australia,This was a slightly disappointing visit. I expected there to be more rides. As an adult I was after more roller coaster and thrill rides. It catered for mainly you d children. Grounds very tidy and clean. The food was also very good. I probably wouldn't return or see the need for a 2 day pass. Everything is able to be achieved in one day. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"481075645,4,2017-5,Australia,""As lovers of all things Disney, the park was accessed via the very efficient rail system  culminating in a Disney train complete with Micky shaped windows etc. the crowds seemed smaller and younger with most little girls attired in a princess dress   very cute. The rides are provided to suit the whole family participating which is really nice. Some rides albeit a bit extreme were enjoyed by young and old alike with no tears or tantrums. Some of the rides  amusements were better than Anaheim and these included the mystic mansion, Disney garden and Toy Story rides. Front of the line passes were available for some rides with the younger rides such as Pooh Bear requiring the longest wait. The food and facilities were excellent and grounds pristine. The new Marvel ride and the Disney Musical experience was great with large groups of people accommodated at each session reducing the wait time. Great gift shops and Pandora now provided exclusive Disney options. Western options available in a cute cafe in Main Street with amazing children's meals.

The lit the tree with LEDs that changed colors, couples in Victorian costume sang carols (the Christian ones too), and snow fell all along Main Street.

480347937,5,2017-4,Australia,We reached with our 2 yr old daughter at 11am and spent the whole day here until the night parade which is NOT TO BE MISSED! The property has amazing rides and extremely good facilities. I would recommend to head out to the rides that you definetly want to go on and scan your pass to get a 'fast pass' at a certain time. Once you do this for all rides you can plan your day around the place and reach the rides at that time to directly walk in rather than waiting in an hour long queue for a 5min ride. There is a storybook kingdom right at the end of the property which is the best ride for children aged 2 6.

Another is common curtesy a certain type of guest have not idea on queuing and covering mouths when they cough and does no selfie sticks mean no selfie sticks, this should be enforced more.

"480054626,4,2017-4,Switzerland,""We went on a regular Friday around 11am under the cloudy sky. Not many people & we needed max 10 min for a ride if there was a line. Some ride we went 2, 3 times in a row without waiting at all, unbelievable!!!I went to Disney Tokyo & Paris, it's smaller. Good if you have smaller kids. Main languages are Cantonese, English & Mandarin.Now it's not allowed to use the selfie stick in the park & I don't see clear indication at the door. The staff sometime screamed at the microphone for some people who didn't understand & the people were really crazy, ignored them too...Toilets are everywhere & it's very clean with staff often cleaning. Souvenir shops are at all the corners waiting for you to spend money.Baby facilities available. Can leave the pushchair just outside the attraction in a special area, sometimes there is someone keep an eye of the area.Last year I went into Space mountain with my 6 year son then, without knowing how it was exactly, however I've asked if he's allowed to go on & he was tall enough, & we would be sitting next to each other. Anyway, it was so scary that I thought he would fly out of the car anytime. This time the Ironman area was built. We visited the Ironman experience. We took our time to ask questions & got detailed answer. If I'm not wrong, there are 4 (cinema liked) rooms, this means less waiting time. It was a tour visit of HK but with Ironman & monster in between, 3D, air, chair moving experience. Nice atmosphere with everyone was laughing & screaming.The ride is fairly short, a min or 2. Sometime the staff spent so much time to check all the doors were closed & secure than the ride.Moneywise, I found it's quite expensive for the daily extrance fee (1 Adult HKD 589) , as well the food, a simple meal easily cost HKD 100. There is a 2 days' pass which you can use 2 times within 7 days period, that's much more interesting (1 Adult HKD 759)Overall, if you're well prepared, it would be a pretty good experience with your kids."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yes 10 rides is nothing to most people but for us who will que for an hour just to have a few minutes of photo taking with Mickey and Minnie, this is an achievement in itself. If it was winter period where sunset is earlier, will not be able to meet it to 10 rides since a fraction of the riders were done in evening.Noticed considerably lesser China tourists than before.Take the meal and ride combo package which offers good value for lunch but food was nothing to shout about however the portion huge."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"479763629,5,2017-4,Canada,""There are 3 ways to go to Disneyland from Hong Kong International Airport: (1) Disney train direct to Disneyland (2) Airport train ride and a bus ride (3) taxi. We ended up taking a taxi as it worked out cheaper and it took less than 15 minutes to get there. It was fairly early in the morning, around 7am, and Disneyland itself didn   t open until 10:00am, so we went straight to the hotel and had buffet breakfast at the restaurant where some of the Disney characters will come out and interact with the guests and take pictures with you. We also ended up keeping our luggage at their storage for free! They also have free shuttles going to from Disneyland from the two hotels in the area that runs every half hour. If you are going direct to Disneyland, they have lockers for your things onsite too, and it will be cheaper than renting a locker at the airport.It   s not a big one compared to the ones in US and Europe but it   s a fair size that you could spend a whole day there and still have something left to do. Most people take 2 days or so on average to enjoy it to the fullest. There various stores, 2 3 parades in a day, tons of rides, and shows. Since it is in Hong Kong, everything is both in English and Cantonese (I think).Grab the schedule of events shows and the map, which is in a shed on the right side before the entrance. You will need it to plan your day to make sure you catch the different shows and parade times. Also, I cannot rave enough about the Ironman Experience (ride). I wasn   t even really planning to go, but that was a fun surprise! Make sure to try it!This place will make you feel like a kid     it really is a happy place!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Lots of food stations and restaurants dotted around, toilets were clean and plentiful. There wasn't a parade at the end of the day due to the fact it had rained and health & safety because of this.

It is not a large park, but large enough when time was limited. I visited on a Saturday and most rides had long lines. It is worth downloading the App as it updates the wait time for rides and was handy in providing general information about the park. Gift shop was extensive in its range. We purchased some mouse ears and they threw in embroidery of the child's name, which was great. Food wasn't bad and they also had gluten free items on the menu which was unexpected.

But, there is a fast food inside near the Marvel area that sells 2pc chicken, 1 rice, 1 drink, and fries for 99hkd.

As always use fast pass when you can and keep hydrated in the warmer months. Technically we could of done the whole park in one day but wanted to take it easy and our time, the new Iron Man experience was new as was some of the other rides. Toy Works was a hoot and the kids loved it. They have a dedicated train to DL via the MTR whiich is super efficient. Highly recommend to people who are first time visitors."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"478472302,5,2017-2,Qatar,""we really came for this attraction. i suggest to go for 2 days ticket because one day is not enough to fully visit all attraction inside disneyland. you will never regret this one, it is really magical and full of happiness place"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
478383940,4,2017-4,Myanmar (Burma),We visited there at Easter Sunday. It was not so crowded and 30 mins Q time in average. My personal opinion is half day is good enough to explore. But make sure you got to stay till the end to experience the night light parade and fireworks. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"478364808,4,2017-4,Australia,""Our visit was cut short by heavy rain, but the parade before this was great to see. Did not get a chance to go on many rides. Overall smaller than Tokyo Disney. But still a magical experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"478198102,4,2017-4,Australia,""From what I've previously heard it's not a small park, like many have said. It's a clean place and well organised.

"478114424,5,2017-4,Australia,""Went mid week with the family. Been to Disneyland in Japan, US and France previously. Never seen such short queues as we did in HK.It was literally a 5 minute queue for most rides. Sure, it is smaller than other Disney theme parks   but if the kids can go on rides multiple times over with little queueing   surely that is preferable? And it's not especially small, still takes a full day to see it all. Easy to access on the MTR. Took us about 50 minutes and two transfers from Kowloon. Use Google Maps to plot your route.Other reviews mention high expense of food   sure it is pricier than usual, but was not over the top in my opinion. I'm sure the queues are larger on weekends and peak times, but mid week   we had no issues. Well worth it if you have a weekday to kill in Hong Kong. Added tips: the kids can participate in the live action Star Wars show, register as Spacetraders   first in, best dressed. The discounted meal ticket (3 in 1 Supreme meal) may be worth exploring (check HK Disneyland website). Had no issues bringing in some snacks water. Bags are inspected for sinister items, but staff cared little re: external food. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"477884376,4,2017-4,China,""I guess it's pretty obvious that there can't be much that isn't fun about going to any Disneyland right. It's very easy to get there using the subway and also very affordable and safe. This was a really good month to go as the lines weren't long at all which made it even more pleasant. Some of the rides etc were close but it didn't matter. Food and cool drinks (and even water) are very pricey, you can pay up to 40 HKD for a water. There's quite a few restaurants, mostly traditional Asian food with a few  American  food stalls here and there. Overall, an amazing experience. And staying for the firework show over the castle at 8pm is definitely worth it. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
477863371,5,2016-12,Indonesia,This place is awsome and reminds us to our childhood experience. You wil need a full day to stroll down the park and enjoy every ride.

"477422432,5,2017-3,Hong Kong,""We go to Disneyland very regularly & we love it. But here's what I've learned.It is always WAY hotter than on HK island. Think 10 degrees hotter. Take Sunscreen, hats or an umbrella for shade. A taxi from HK island with no traffic (not realistic some days) takes only 30 minutes. Way less hassle than 2 trains with small kids.Don't queue to meet the characters. Book well in advance for the enchanted restaurant buffet for dinner at the Disneyland resort hotel. They run shuttles. The characters go to every table. You can get tons of photos, a reasonable feed, & the kids will be beside themselves with excitement.Work out the parade time. And then stake out somewhere shady to watch it from. Best to be away from the park entrance as you just end up waiting way longer there.

"477359395,5,2017-1,Australia,""While it is the smallest of the parks we have visited, it feels like Hong Kong Disney opted for quality vs quantity. We found it refreshing to be able to see the park without rushing from ride to ride to see everything. As hotel guests, we were fortunate enough to be able to experience Iron Man, which was in its soft opening phase, and space mountain still had the Star Wars overlay. But it was the unique takes they had on rides that resulted in my two thumbs up. Mystic Manor was amazing, Grizzly Gulch was a good thrill and Jungle Cruise has it's own unique twist. Even more impressive was the in park dining. It was brilliant to walk away from a quick service meal having had something equally tasty and healthy. I admired the multilingual approach that rides took, often catering for Cantonese, Mandarin and English languages in clever ways. The best example of this was Mickey and the Wonderous Book. The only downside we found was the photopass, which operates and the same system as Shanghai, and there are simply not enough photopass photo opportunities!As we wanted to visit for three days and the tickets offered were a maximum of two days, we were recommended to look at upgrading to an annual pass, which we did and as a result have tacked Hong Kong onto our Tokyo trip.

Didn't have very long wait lines for almost everything except in Fantasyland. Good dining food, but not great snacks like at some of the other parks. Would've liked to buy a hot dog or something more than popcorn but not ice cream. A bit small, would only need 1 day there. Easy to get to using the MTR. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"477244562,5,2017-4,United States,""We just returned from our latest trip to Hong Kong and a visit to Hong Kong Disney. It did not disappoint. It is an English speaking Disney with wide tree lined sidewalks. Crowding is not an issue as it is in the United States as there is plenty of room to walk around. The park doesn't open until about 10am with some rides opening at 11am, like Small World. I recommend starting at the back of the park, then working your way to the front, since we have seen everyone else doing the opposite. Had no trouble riding everything multiple times, never needed a fast pass. The most beautiful Small World (and largest) is located here. It has a bridge and is just breath taking if you are a Small World fan. You may need a respirator when you see the size of it. Overwhelming for sure. Mystic Manor is an outstanding ride that rivals anything I have seen (technologically) at Disney World in Orlando. To get to this park, it is very easy to take the train in and out. You'll arrive at a very pretty Disney train station. There is lots of pin trading here, and Hong Kong pins are easy to get. What great souvenirs! Because this location is so close to the Big Buddha, you could do both on the same day. Go to Buddha in the morning (early) and beat the heat, then train over to Disney since they do not open until 10am. You can do this park in a day. Great for all ages."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"477170770,3,2017-4,United States,""If you have never visited any other Disney Park in the world, then this is a nice beginner's experience. The park is small and on a non peak day, you can ride all the rides in about three hours. I went to the park on a holiday peak day, but the longest line I had to wait on was marked 35 minute wait time but it was only 20 minutes. The Iron Man experience is the only exclusive ride there. Everything else can be found in other Disney Parks. (It's A Small World. Hyper Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Winnie The Pooh, etc.). It is missing a lot of iconic Disney Rides   Splash Mountain, Cinderella Carousel, etc.If you don't go to this park, you won't really miss much. I would not call this a must do attraction.

"476680394,4,2017-4,Australia,""I'm writing this review so that other travellers can get an idea of how busy it is at Hong Kong Disneyland during the Ching Ming festival. I could not find any information about how busy it would be on this particular public holiday so hopefully this information will be helpful for someone else.As we came in on a cruise we couldn't pick our day of arrival (or the time unfortunately) As a result we arrived late in the afternoon. Yes it was a little crowded but we didn't have to queue more than half an hour for our desired rides. We didn't get to check out all the classic rides at Fantasyland because we ran out of time. This was because we were forced to arrive so late in the day, not because we spent ages queueing elsewhere in the park.The only rides that we saw queues that went for more than an hour were in the Toy Story area. Luckily we weren't too fussed about going on them.This is definitely a park for younger children. We had children aged from 5 to 11 and they all loved it. None of the roller coasters have loops and the rides don't go too high on the thrill factor. The only characters we lined up for were at Tomorrowland. The line to see both BB8 and Chewbacca were really short. No one in our party were particularly interested in seeing Mickey and Co. so I couldn't tell you how long the wait was. Ask every staff cast member that you see if they have stickers. We became obsessed with collecting them.We bought the play and dine offer available on the website which meant that we got a free meal. The staff at the restaurant in Tomorrowland were really helpful to explain what we could order. The food was of a theme park standard. Plenty of western options available if your young one isn't open to trying the Asian options.Our highlights were the fairy garden, mystic manor, hyperspace mountain and the awesome fireworks show at the end of the day.I also had trouble trying to find out how much the Minnie Mouse ear headbands cost before coming to the park so here's the prices as at 4th April 2017: The headband with sequins was HKD138 and the plain polka dot ones were HKD118. My boys weren't really interested in the options available for them so I can't tell you how much the goofy hats cost.If there's a good deal going on cheap flights to Hong Kong i'm tempted to try and visit with the kids again (if only to get all the stickers, mwah hahahahaha!)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"476045167,5,2017-4,United Kingdom,""In order to differentiate this review from others, my opinion might be relevant to other Europeans visiting Disney Hong Kong whilst on holiday. We visited for one day right at the end of our 2 week trip around China and initially thought that all the logistics about what to do with our luggage would make the visit overly difficult. We solved this by checking in our 3 large hold suitcases at 9am at Kowloon Station for our later 11pm flight (a great idea from HKG airport) and then leaving our 3 hand luggage items in a large locker on Main St once inside the attraction (100 hkd for the day). At the fund of the day we then took the MTR from Disney to Tsing Yi MTR and the hopped onto the airport express line using our previously bought return tickets.Travel aside, we ( dad, mum and 8 y.o.) really enjoyed our single day here and felt that we had seen all we had wanted to see in a day. Others mention always spending 2 days in he park and I guess this would allow for a more leisurely experience but for us 10am to 6pm worked. In contrast when we visited Paris about 3 yrs ago there was no way to cover most things in a day   overall we felt as if Disney HKG was smaller than Paris, but this was no ad thing for us. Lastly, our personal highlights were the Lion King show, the Iron Man 3D simulator and meeting Chewbacca..."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Plenty of food options across the park.Transport is best using the MTR network, the trains returning are regular and you didn't have to line up, due to frequency.

"476002881,4,2017-4,Singapore,""This place was on our bucket list. So visited with our children. Overall a nice place. Typical Disneyland. We booked tickets through Klook, which got us Auto magic access without any need to wait in ticket lines. Automagic is nothing but getting your printed tickets from a machine by using QR code on your Klook tickets. So we just walked in within no time. All attractions are very nice. But the highlight is Disney Character parade during the day and in the evening with fireworks. The only difference is that the parade songs are in Mandarin language. A must do attraction is R Racer in Toy Story land something very thrilling. Make sure that you occupy the benches in front of Castle at around 615 630pm.

"475928189,5,2016-5,Philippines,""Been to the park 6 times as we always buy a 2 days pass. Disney magic is simply because they make each rides better than other theme parks. It is little things, could be like adding interactive feature or making the ride longer where you feel it was worth trying for every ride. You have to go though on a weekday or buy an express pass. You should also go when it opens. The rides in tomorrow land and fantasy land are usually long since it is close to entrance. The farther sections would have less. The shows are also great, the lines are long even on a weekday and I recommend falling in line early like as soon as they let people in so you seat at the front. Then there's the parade and fireworks. So one day is never enough."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are just themed differently.Compared to California Disneyland, park tickets were fairly cheap. Check with your hotel if they offer any discounts on tickets. We were able to save about 50 HKD per ticket by ordering tickets through our hotel.Overall, we had a great time here. It was really neat too see a differently Disneyland then we are use too.

I suggest to buy the 2 day pass in order to have plenty time to visit all the wonderful themed worlds around the park.My favorite , the mine roller coaster!!

Except if you want a photo with characters Mickey and Mini  get there as soon as they open or half an hour before and go to the main circle and start lining up first. The first day we caught the train from central HK city  terrible idea   took too long to get there. Caught an uber home. Very quick, luxury and not too much more than the train (family of 5). Next day uber there and back. The only downside I would say is lack of food options and availability. If you're travelling with young children take food and drinks. It takes too long to go and find a food stall and then when you do they only serve the same thing   nothing healthy. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"475496135,5,2017-3,India,""Disney is a magical experience by itself always! It was my third time but it was as exciting as the first time! Disney, has this 'feel great' sense that overcomes you almost as soon as you see Mickey welcoming you at the gates! The experience just gets more wonderful from there on... Disney, has the best places to eat and the parades get better each time. This time was the spring parade and the welcoming band, it's such a pleasurable experience. My fav ride is Space Mountain, thrilling pitch dark roller coaster zooming on the rails whilst Star Wars tells you a story in the background! My tip is: do your shopping as you're going through the park and have the cashier desks deliver your parcels to the main counter at the exit. They will give you your bill and a pink slip. All you have to do is cut short the fireworks time by 5 minutes to collect your parcel from the exit gate's main counter before the park shuts. This way you can walk light as you explore the park, still do your shopping since waiting to visit Main Street till the night parade leaves you in a mad rush and crazy billing lines.

All of the staff (or cast as they're called) were on the ball and helpful   you can see how well they're trained. The parades were choreographed to perfection and wowed the youngsters.

First off I have to say we have been lucky enough to visit Orlando Disney on many occasions so we found it difficult to not compare the two parks. We found staff to be lovely whenever we encountered them, no issues at all. The park was clean. We went to the Iron Man experience and have to be honest we all found it a little disappointing, it was a nice ride but think we expected more from it. We rode the Toy. Story space rangers ride which was the same a Orlando but it kept stopping   not sure if it was a technical issue but did detract from the ride a little. Witnessed some inconsiderate behaviour in the queues   people coming out the queues then literally shoving past people to get back in. We queued for a while to ride the Jungle River Rapids, we weren't overly impressed with this ride (although the staff worked hard to make it fun). We then went to Toy Story Land and rode the Racing Car ride   waited for 1 2 hour but it was well worth it   great ride. It was a nice day out, the castle was very underwhelming compared to Orlando, the park in general was much smaller but it is a nice park and worth a visit.

"474451880,4,2017-2,Philippines,""Notes on my review";" my wife and I went as a couple to HK (didn't bring the kids along) and were on a tight budget. We haven't been to any other Disneyland theme parks. But we definitely made this as a  cannot miss  itinerary during our first visit to HK. 1). Be prepared for a lot of walking   It is a large theme park, so make sure you wear comfortable shoes (or slippers sandals), bring sufficient drinking water (depending on how much hydration you need), and wear comfortable clothing (depending on weather forecast or season). Moving from one theme area to another involves quite a lot of walking if you sum it all up. I had my pedometer on and clocked over 13k steps for the whole day we spent there. 2). Buy your ticket online   Decided to buy our tickets online to save a bit and avoid the queue at the ticket booths there. So when we got to Disneyland we were able to skip the line for tickets and went straight to the entrance. (We went on a weekday so I noticed the line wasn't so bad. But it does add to the time you waste waiting in line) 3). Allocate a whole day for this visit   With the size of the park, plus the different attractions, rides or activities. You definitely will need to plan this as a whole day visit. We were there from 11am to 8pm (to watch the fireworks) and we were just a couple visiting. If your bringing children along, being earlier (be there by 10am) will definitely give you a more relaxed pace to go around and enjoy a lot of the attractions. 4). Weekend or Weekday?   Important note, we went on a weekday so I don't have first hand experience on weekend volume of people (its just a hunch). If milling around in a park with a LOT of people trying to get in line to the different attractions is NOT your thing then I suggest going on a weekday. Fewer people   shorter lines   more attractions to visit or ride. Granted there are some attractions that might be closed, but its just a handful so it was not a big deal for me. Longest wait time we had for an attraction was at the carousel and it took us approx 10mins to get seated. I can just imagine the weekday crowd pushing the wait time to at least twice that duration (just a hunch). 5). Bring your own water and food   being on a budget, we brought our own food and water. At first I was thinking these might not be allowed but we got them through and saved some money. For portability we brought a few sandwiches and 3L of water (for the both of us). 6) Notes on gadgets   make sure your phones cameras are fully charged and bring extra powerbanks and maybe memory (if you tend to take a ton of pictures and videos) if your phone camera has limited capacity. Having pictures and videos of your visit is a mortal sin (okay, not a sin but helps build nice memories) when visiting Disneyland. There are also certain areas with free wifi in the park so that helps you in updating your twitter, instragram or facebook accounts as you are experiencing the wonder of Disneyland. 7). Check the schedule of activities on their website or app   To make sure you don't miss on any major shows   activities. Make sure to check their website or app for whatever is happening on the day you plan to visit. This will help you decide what to watch or visit as some shows or activities overlap one another. 8). Check the HK forum for advice, suggestions and tips on Disneyland   I'm an organized   planning person, so doing research on where I'm visiting is a must. Check the HK forums here at Tripadvisor and you'll get tons of advice or answer to questions."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

474373145,5,2017-4,Russia,What can say   I wish we could come back again. One thing I would advise the Park's administration to think about is some quiet air conditioned places for people to have some rest.

Don't forget to buy meal tickets as well because the food inside Disneyland is a bit pricey. Aside from the rides we got a bit gaga over original items that you can find in their stores and mind you there are plenty of stores scattered around the park! You should try the Grizzly ride and it's not for the faint at heart. Same with the mountain space ride. The new Toy story attraction is worth the longline and will definitely go back.

"472773299,5,2017-3,United States,""We purchased the tickets to Hong Kong Disney Viatour. It is easier than buying them through the Disney website.We took the MTR and transferred to the Disney Line. The Disney experience starts with Disney Line. This train is pretty cool with Mickey shaped windows and hand holds. We can see the excitement in the kids riding this train! There is a little bit of walking from the training station to the park entrance. There were two food trucks on the way to the park entrance so you can stop to eat before or after visiting the park. The park itself is smaller than Disneyland or Disney World. That is a plus because we didn't get as tired going through the park. The Star War tour has been converted to an Iron Man Experience which we dubbed the  Stark Tour.  We always enjoy this ride. There is no Haunted Mansion here, instead they have the Mystic Manor ride. We loved it. The character creation, back stories, and animation is exceptional. This has become my daughter's favorite ride. There are many more of the fun disney rides. They have churros! We watched the parade in the afternoon and later the electric lights parade at night.Disneyland have buses to go to the resort hotels"; but it is back where the train stop is;" so it is quite a walk to get there. So be sure to plan ahead on the rides and getting to the resorts if you are having lunch there. Overall, a very enjoyable experience! We really liked the new rides.

"472520863,5,2017-3,Singapore,""Before we hopped over to the park, we did a session for our two girls at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. It is the make over studio for girls to become the princess of their dreams. My pre schoolers had great fun. One chose to be Rapunzel and one chose to be Anna. The staff were friendly and cheerful and put our girls at ease very quickly. After the make over, the photographer came to take photos of the girls. During the photo session, parents are welcome to take photos using their own cameras. Only 1 photo in a nice folder is included in the package. You can purchase more at additional costs (HKD 160 each or HKD 1600 for a hard coffee table book consisting of 10 photos). The staff were not pushy at all when it came to the photos. No pressure to purchase any additional photos at all. They also took home all the costumes, hairpiece, boxes of rings (Disney Princesses themed, of course), earring stickers and a little bottle of nail polish. Just a reminder, you have to make an appointment prior to the session. We made the appointment months before when we booked our room at the resort. I tried to change the appointment time closer to the day and was told the timing of our choice was full. I think they are quite busy. While we were in there, there was a steady stream of little princesses (to be) coming in and little princesses going out. And it was considered very low peak season when we were there as the park was not crowded at all. For 1 little princess, do be prepared to spend a little over an hour in the boutique as there is the choosing the costume to be done (depending on whether your little one is a fast decision maker or not), the actual make over, the photo taking (assuming no queue) then the choosing of the photos on the iPad and finally waiting a few minutes to receive the photo.The girls enjoyed themselves, we enjoyed seeing the girls dolled up and they have loads of fun with the costume at home nowadays so I would say it was worth the (hefty) price(tag). But I think the next time they get this dolled up (complete with photographer) would be either their prom night or wedding day. ";")"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

Unfortunately it appears Mickey runs on an extremely tight schedule. Every time we queued up to catch a glimpse, we were told in an extremely curt manner that Mickey was on a break or that the queue was now closed. In a park as big as this, could they risk two Mickey characters wandering around, so as not to disappoint the many children who have come to see him? If you adore shopping for Disney themed souvenirs, then this is the place for you. The whole park has been set up, almost exclusively, to do this alone.

"471360019,4,2017-3,United States,""I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim, California and Disney World in Orlando, Florida in the United States, and this is definitely the most compact Disney park I've been to. But there is an advantage to its small size: You walk less. This is especially advantageous if you have very young children. In Disneyland or Disney World, you must do so much walking that even the adults poop out after half a day. The HK Disney Park is so compact and if you go on a weekday, you could finish visiting the Park in half a day! I was there today, arriving by MTR in the morning at about 10:45 (It opened at 10:30). There were no long lines awaiting to go in. I went straight to the entrance turnstile and show the attendant my ticket code (I ordered the ticket online early in the morning), and he processed my ticket immediately. I walked down Main Street (by passing all the photo opportunities with Disney characters) and went straight to Tomorrowland. There I immediately went to the Iron Man ride which I expected to be the most crowded since it's Disney's newest ride. I was surprised that I was in my seat within 10 minutes. I followed it with Hyperspace Mountain, Starwars Command Post, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster and Orbitron (since all were in Tomorrowland), and all waited no more than 10 minutes. I then went to the next theme section, Fantasyland, and tried their most popular ride, Winnie the Pooh, and once again the wait was no more than 10 minutes. I followed that ride with one of Disneyland's best known, It's A Small World, was able to walk right in. Then went to see the shows Mickey and the Wondrous Book and Mickey's PhilharMagic, and once again walked right in without waiting. I wanted to watch Festival of the Lion King in Adventureland but it was closed until April. So I went to Grizzley Gulch but decided I did not care to ride the Mine Cars Rollercoaster so I proceeded to the Mystic Manor which is similar to the old Haunted Mansion and once again was in within 10 minutes. I entered the park at 10:45 a.m. was actually ready to leave at 3:00 p.m. If it were not for the afternoon parade which started at 3:45 p.m. I would have departed at 3:00 p.m. I did not have to use the Fast Pass feature of my ticket at all and was able to repeat a couple of rides with very little waiting. So from this, I conclude that you can do this park in one day if you go on a weekday and arrive by opening time. But like all Disneylands, I recommend you have a plan of routing before going to save yourself time and unnecessary steps. Here are some of my suggestions after being there today: 1. Order your tickets online to save waiting in line to purchase tickets. 2. Bring water and small snacks (cookies, chocolate bars, trail mix packs) but leave your lunch size sandwiches behind as park security will not allow bringing food items into the park.3. The MTR ride from the Hong Kong Station to the Disney Station takes at least half and hour, so allow yourself adequate time for transportation in order to get there by opening time.4. Once you enter the park, by pass photos with all the Disney characters on Main Street and go to the Information Board to the right of the Circle before reaching the Castle and check ride closures and show parade times. 5. Then head straight for the first ride on your planned route. Most people in Hong Kong don't seem to be early birds so you should not have to wait long for these first few rides.6. Be sure to work in the shows into your schedule: Mickey & the Wondrous Book, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Festival of the Lion King. 7. Lastly, also work in the afternoon and the evening parade (if you're staying til closing) as well as the fireworks show to complete your Hong Kong Disney adventure."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Probably also because it was drizzling, and we're glad that the heavy rainpour happened in the early morning before the park opens. I'm lucky that I did not encounter any bad behaviors from the mainlanders which I read in some of the posts. I would think that 1 day is enough to cover the whole place. But if you are like us who likes to take pictures and autographs from the characters, 2 days will be a comfortable pace so as to cover the rides, shows and parades. The shows are good, make sure to catch them when you are there. We enjoyed ourselves on the ride. The parades were entertaining and the firework was fantastic.

Some suitable for teenages and above like Grizzly gulch. I never expected the roller coaster would run backwards with high speed! I also thought the fireworks was those normal fireworks show at night. But, alot of audience started fill up the place in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle 1 hour before the performance and the whole place was even full after the night parade. I also noticed that this theme park not only full of kids and parents but, old people and old couples were enjoying themselves too.

"470097162,5,2017-3,United States,""This was my first Disney Park park experience outside of the USA. While numerous reviews on the park are mediocre, I will admit that I loved this park from park opening to park close. Must sees: Hong Kong Disneyland has a number of exclusive attractions you won't find anywhere else in the world!  Mystic Manor was INCREDIBLE! Mind blowing and fun! Everything you want from Disney! Grizzly Gulch was classic Disney. Amazing! A great new interpretation of Big Thunder Mountain. So much fun, and just AWESOME!  Iron Man Experience! This surprised me how much I liked it! A great motion simulator designed after StarTours, this ride really takes you to the streets of Hong Kong with Iron man as you battle evil! Incredibly well done!   Festival of the Lion King   this version is a bit different from the Orlando version, but it is amazing!!!! inspiring, fun and a must see  All 3 Parades   there were 3 parades when we visited and they were all must see! Just pure disney magic!   Hyperspace Mountain   this redo of space mountain featuring StarWars, was INCREDIBLE. I was surprised how much I liked it. Simply brilliant and fun!  Fireworks. Everyday has to end with fireworks at Disneyland... and Hong Kong is the same. The fireworks were amazing, romantic and a perfect way to end the day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"470032618,4,2017-3,Australia,""Easily accessible by train from Hong Kong Station Very toddlers friendly We downloaded the mobile app which indicate the waiting time for popular ride Rides like Dumbo , Cinderella, Winnie the Pooh , the small world , train are all toddlers friendly Waiting time average 20 minutes The parade starts at 1915 and last for 25 minutes Followed by fireworks at 2015 There are many F&B outlets too Good dim sum at Plaza Inn on the USA Main Street Priority is given to old man with wheel chair   my father at 92 years of age even rode on Dumbo and Winnie the Pooh This is the most child friendly Disneyland we have been Very enjoyable "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"470011689,3,2017-3,United Kingdom,""There are not many things surprised. It's just a normal place for childen.I'm sure that many people expect a lot before going in, but would be failed or disappointed, since it's so normal except the forest zone.As well, there are not many useful or valueable stuffs to buy in the souvenir shops, but very expensive. The food inside the disneyland was so expensive, you should not eat anything inside, even a cone of icecream. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"470010389,5,2016-4,Australia,""Take the train from where ever you are, you may need to swap trains until you get to the Disney line, this is where the magic begins, young or young at heart, the Disney themed train gets you ready for the Disneyland experience.We arrived as the gates opened and stayed until closing. Our day at Disneyland was overcast with a light drizzle all day, great, we only queued for the lion king show, all other rides we went straight on. The drizzle didn't dampen our experience at all. We didn't need to try out the express pass system which took the pressure off although looking at the queue areas there is obviously a lot of people on a fine day.Surprisingly we all enjoyed the Mystic Manor with its journey through each area with the story unfolding as you go great. Take the train ride around the park and make the most of the photo moments.Food was pricey but nothing more than you would expect from a captive audience, Waffle at $50 was Ok for the experience but $45 for a hotdog which was a bit dry and the bun a little crispy was stretching the friendship.The fireworks at the end of the night last for ages (over 11 minutes), a must do part of the Disneyland experience.We had no problems getting a taxi back to our hotel, once again I would suggest this would be a lot different on a fine day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"469972293,5,2017-3,Australia,""We arrived when the gates opened and left after the fireworks. It's easy to spend a whole day here   we only repeated two things: we saw the Lion King show twice (it's that good) and rode Space Mountain two times. We did pretty much every ride available and had a great day. The only downside, several restaurants were closed during our visit limiting our options and the food we did get was pretty gross. The parade and firworks show was amazing, be sure to stick around for it!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"469956028,4,2017-3,Australia,""We bought 2 toddlers  1 and 2 year olds to Hong Kong Disneyland and am quite surprised there were plenty for them to do  as in rides. Mainly at fantasyland. I counted there were at least 12 rides that does not have height or age restrictions which is plenty for a toddler. Most of them are also wheelchair friendly. Which by the way, wheelchair people have priority when it comes to queuing up.We went on a Friday and it was literally a pram city. It was quite busy but not packed. Some rides you had to wait for nearly an hour.There are plenty to eat. If you are worried if there is any Chinese food to eat.. there is a restaurant serving Yum cha  plaza inn (on the Main Street on your left before you enter fantasyland).Their app is great and easy to use. And save you a lot of trouble walking back and forth. It also tells you the wait times for the popular rides. Free wifi is available at the park. You will have to sign in every 15mins because that is the max limit their allowed for each time you log in. The park is very clean. The toilets by the end of the day was disgusting unlike a typically clean Hong Kong toilet, most likely due to the mass number of tourist who don't know how to use the toilet properly. The easiest and fastest way to get to HK Disneyland is by train from central. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"469796327,5,2017-3,Malaysia,""Amazing experience for us and my twin 8 year olds. They were quite skeptical on some rides, but it is very children friendly rides.

"469273213,5,2017-1,Philippines,""this place will take back your inner kid's heart. every corner is worth a selfie. the rides and shower are amazing, awesome, and enjoyable. To enjoy more, you better stay here after lunch till the closing time. foods and soveniers here are much higher here than outside so better bring your water or eat outside before you go here. My favorite rides are the big grizzly mountain, mystic manor and space mountain and my favorite part of our visit were during the lanter parade and fire works showcase.

"469268469,4,2017-3,Australia,""Great day at HK Disneyland. It's a much smaller park than Anaheim but with intense sun and heat, we were grateful to get around most of the park in a day. There's plenty to do and we were there from the minute it opened until close and we missed out on plenty. The parades were awesome, Springtime procession, paint the night and fireworks were all must sees! Be aware, we used a global wallet card and all our credit card transactions were duplicated across multiple currencies and have not been returned two days later still waiting for help on this. Overall park was great and hard to criticize when I love Minnie so much. Be organized though we waited 90 minutes at the start for photos with Minnie and Mickey and got sunburnt in the process. Those of us who have been to other Disney Parks may be disappointed with the more limited merchandise selection. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
469083367,4,2017-3,Singapore,Lots of fun activities and parade going on . Doesn't need to wait long for each ride and shows . Best of the experience is the fireworks show with theme .,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"469058778,5,2017-3,United Kingdom,""My partner and I (who hasn't been to a Disney park before) went for the day. This was plenty of time (we arrived early) and got to see all the attractions. We queued for 15 minutes at max for any of the rides. Only disappointment was the lack of choice of food and also that a few rides were closed for maintenance. Otherwise, a fun day and lots of different attractions. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"469011361,3,2017-2,Thailand,""We travelled here in February, which I think is the peak of low season, as such, quite a few attractions were closed for maintenance. The park itself is not huge, but enjoyable for my 5 year old daughter. The bonus was that there were hardly any queues and we managed to return multiple times to her favourite rides. The food offering was limited and really bad ... A number of dining joints were closed ... Worth taking your little ones."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
469006478,5,2017-3,United States,Just like Disneyland in the states this is truly the happiest place on earth. This is a must do for anyone visiting Hong Kong with or without kids. The best part is it's much cheaper than both Disneyland and Disney world!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
468950199,5,2017-3,United States,This park is very different from Disneyworld in Orlando. It is much smaller. We were only there for half a day and we felt like we saw most of it. I think 1 to 2 days would be the maximum. It was easy to navigate and the attractions were inventive. We loved the Toy Story park! The only downside we noticed was that there wasn't a  fine dining  option for dinner there (unlike Orlando) as we wanted to have dinner for my cousin's birthday.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"468809958,4,2017-3,South Korea,""Went in March, which it was warm but not hot and humid, so it was comfortable in terms of weather. Also, went on Monday to avoid weekenders. There were basically no lines for rides and it wasn't crowded at all. So, perhaps weekdays could be ideal. We've been to Orlando, CA and Tokyo Disney and I would say Hong Kong is the smallest (not a bad thing!). The hours are shorter as well (ends at 8:30pm or so). So, it's a good one day event and don't really need to spend more than a day unless it's too crowded and you can't get on all the rides. We got there little after opening time (opened at 10:30am) and it was plenty of time to go through it all. When walking up from the subway station (not sure on bus or taxi but subway was super easy and recommended with the Octopus card, the public subway transfers directly to Disney train tram), we noticed luggage valet area where you can drop off your luggage and pick it up later. I thought this was a nice service if you need to check out of hotel and you got a late flight out. I think it was only $100HK. The rides are mostly similar and or same vs other Disney parks but there's some new unique to Hong Kong. I would say it's more tailored to younger family as the rides are not as scary or hard. Our kids are 6 and 9 and they had a blast. Even Toy Story RC ride was good enough for adults while kids thought it was fun. It's a small world ride is also updated with Disney characters and they did a great job with a classic ride. In all, just keep your expectations in check and you will have fun.

"468575966,4,2017-3,Singapore,""I have been here three times in the past 5 years and I observe that the crowd in HK is less than Disneyland Tokyo or even Paris (esp now that Shanghai Disneyland is open, most China tourists go there instead of HK one). The new attractions   Iron Man Experience and Hyperspace Mountain are super cool. Thrill seekers will also love Big Grizzly Mountain. Go for those rides! The queue is not too long (manageable). Food wise  i think Royal Banquet Hall in Fantasyland has the best range of food (international, Jap and grill). Price is around $120 140 per set. If you are planning this as your last day activity before flying off (like we did. Our flight is at 9pm), take a taxi from Disneyland to the airport. Cheaper and faster. Only around HKD120 (including luggages fees) and you need not transfer trains. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"468507370,3,2017-3,Malaysia,""I visited this place together with my sister's family and this was the second Disneyland I have visited. The other one was the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California.The positive aspects: We enjoyed the Ironman ride, the Star Wars hyperspace mountain ride, the Mystic manor ride, the Grizzly Gulch runaway mine cart ride, the Lion King show, Mickey's Magical book show and Mickey's Philharmagic show. You need to plan your schedule in the theme park carefully in order to get to see the shows at the designated times. Long queues for the rides is a normal sight, you have to be patient and be prepared to queue up between 45 minutes and 1 hour for each ride.The negative aspects: Not surprisingly, 85% of the visitors to this Disneyland comprise of mainland Chinese tourists. The worst thing about this is, these people are really rude, rowdy, impatient and down right ill mannered. They let their young children pee all over the place in public instead of taking them to the washrooms, which are conveniently located all over the theme park! Here is an example";" while we were queueing for the Disney train ride within the park(the train which takes visitors from Fantasyland to the main street station), there was a mainland Chinese family who had a toddler of around 3 years old behind us in the queue. The toddler told his father that he needed to answer a call of nature and the father told him to do it right there and then, on the pavement!!! We watched in horror as the father unzipped the boy's trousers and let him pee right on the pavement, 2 feet away from us!!!!!! Totally disgusting!!!!!! That wasn't the only such incident we witnessed!!! All day long, as we walked around the park, we saw countless such incidents where mainland Chinese families let their children pee in the planter boxes, flower shrubs, next to the lamp posts and on the pavements in public!!!If you and your family want to have a great, enjoyable experience in a Disney theme park, do not come here! Please visit the Disneyland in Anaheim, California. People there are more civilized, civic conscious, hygienic, courteous and well mannered."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

We had the blessed opportunity to all the existing Disney Parks (Florida, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Los Angeles). Let me give you some real expectations.  it's small, the smallest of all the parks.  the rides are very different: Haunted Mansion is actually called Mystic Manor and is very light hearted and has no mentions of ghosts or ghouls. No  99 Happy Haunts.    instead of churros they have pressed squid.  staff is VERY polite and friendly.   the castle is small.  ... saying everything is small turned out to be one of the BEST aspects of the entire trip!!! 3 min lines for rides, we walked up to a parade in progress, we stayed to watch the fireworks   5 people from the front row, easy to navigate the park. ... it was just amazing. It wasn't a crowd of people and 2 hour waits for a 2minute ride. It was a genuinely relaxing and fun experience.   the food was incredible!

"468038244,3,2017-3,United States,""Another trip to Hong Kong Disneyland. I have been here over twenty times. I must say that the overall standards in terms of service and attitude have decreased dramatically. There are still some cast members that try to do their jobs as best as possible, but it is evident that most of them display a hatred for their jobs. Everything is getting more expensive, but it clearly does not reflect in their guest service and guest interaction. Hardly any smiles and no one goes out of their way to make it a magical moment for the guests. When my mom who was actually very happy to come to Disneyland this month wanted to take a photo with a storm trooper, she was denied. However, when it was evident that there two obvious looking foreigners, then they gave them exceptional service and allowed them to take photos and gave them handshakes. This type of behavior should not exist at Disneyland and it shows that management does a really poor job on training and oversight. Overall, it was a very substandard service kind of day. The food is just okay. It used to be better. Hopefully, management will read enough of these reviews to care to better manage their parks and resorts."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"467718754,5,2016-10,Indonesia,""Friends advised that this is a great park to visit with young children. We took our daughter for her eighth birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint.Having done a lot of research we spread our visit over a day and a half in the middle of the week. This was perfect. There was barely a queue for any ride we wanted to go on. The day and a half meant we didn't have to rush on anything and gave us time to queue to see Mickey and Minnie and revisit our favourite rides. We used the spare half day to get our daughter a princess make over at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique and go for a character dinner at the Enchanted garden in the Disneyland hotel.This is a park suited to younger children. A few of the rides are quite young i.e. the teacups. That said, there is the ubiquitous space mountain, the brilliant run away mine cars (our favourite) and several others to keep the wider family amused. There are  characters  all over the park, ranging from the traditional characters and princesses right through to storm troopers and Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch). My biggest tip is to walk right on past the first mickey and minnie you will see just inside the park. We did queue for these on the second morning and waited an hour and half! We didn't mind as we had already done most of the park on the first day so had the time. Walk on by and you will no doubt see more Mickey and Minnies in other parts of the park with no queues.The park has the usual Disney day time and evening parades with the fireworks. These are not on the scale you might see in WDW in Florida. As an example we saw 3 floats in the day time parade. Together with the dancers it had passed us within about 10 minutes. But you won't fight for a spot to see it and the kids are still blown away by the whole thing. The night time fireworks were really brilliant.A particular tip is to make time to see the Lion King performance. It was absolutely outstanding and really worth doing. This alone is a good reason to do more than one day at the park as the timing of the performances can get tight with also seeing things like the day time parade. We did find eating here a little bit of a challenge. There are lots of places selling high sugar or on the go snacks, but not many options to eat properly. This can be a bit of a challenge if you're staying for the whole day (the park closes at 8), and have hungry kids. We went to the main street corner cafe which was ok but nothing great.It's worth being aware of the location. If you don't know, HK is on several islands and so it can take a bit of time to get out to Disney. There are public transport options but if you're just visiting HK and really want to do the whole park I would recommend staying at the resort (there are two hotels) as it does give you more flexibility. We mixed a stay at first in the city with two nights at Disney and this worked well.The staff are the usual friendly Disney crew. Lots of smiles, and stickers for the kids. Basically this place has all the right Disney magic without the crowds! A winner for me."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"467685300,4,2017-2,United States,""We went on a Monday, there was no line longer than 30 minutes. Compared to the Disney's in the US, it was much smaller, but worth the price.

Fantastic parades and a very impressive fireworks show at the end.I was a little disappointed that a few of the rides were closed for maintenance but the was still plenty of rides available for the family to enjoy Overall a great way to spend a day when visiting Hong Kong whether you are with children or not,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
467614490,5,2016-10,Germany,There are many theme lands in HK Disneyland and none of them fail to amaze you. The connecting metro is also styled in Disney fashion. It was just amazing experience,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"467533621,5,2017-2,Macau,""It said to be the happiest place on Earth. And it proved because of its wonderful theme and art piece with gave us a jaw dropping experience. From the entrance up to the rides, it gives us the most happiest moment of our lives. We took many photos of the beautiful art pieces like castle, take a ride and it seemed that we are truly on a magical world. We spent one day walking around the place and satisfies with what we have seen. We also take the most exciting rides and shout like there's no tomorrow. After all, we have watched the parade and see the beautiful art work of Disney Characters and most especially the jaw dropping fireworks with musical background of A whole New World mix which we've never missed at the end of stay. Such a great experience!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"467477612,3,2017-3,United Kingdom,""If you're in Hong Kong for a limited amount of time, I would recommend Ocean Park instead especially if you don't have kids! Not much to  thrill  you if you're between 16 40 years old haha but great for the younger ones!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
467406814,4,2017-3,Netherlands,I am propably one of the biggest Disneyland fans in the world. Because of that I didn't have a lot of expectations of Disneyland Hong Kong. We visited it last week. Weather was okey and it was so quiet! Unbelievable. We could do every attraction twice and even had some time left. I loved the Grizzly train and Mystic Mansion. The last one is one of the best attractions I've ever been in. I was disapointment of the Iron Man Experience and the fact that a lot of restaurants where closed.Overall a fun day and a must do for Disney lovers. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
467311898,5,2016-4,Malaysia,My childhood dreams did come true. Best days of my life and I would want to go back there if given the chance. The parade and fireworks were my most unforgettable part of the whole experience.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"467270024,3,2016-5,Hong Kong,""I live in California and have been to Disneyland in Anaheim several times. My first time to Hong Kong Disneyland was a nice 1 2 day trip. Its quite small and has very few rides. I think its a nice place if you have very young children, but for the teens there are only a couple of rides."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
467261430,5,2017-3,Canada,All the fun and excitement of any Disneyland park.... just a little smaller with an Asian touch. Get there right at 10am. Hit your most wanted attraction first then easily cruise around and see the rest of the park all day. Food and drink is not cheap but what is at Disney. A couple must go on rides. Space mountain. RC Remote in toy story land. Mine car canyon in adventureland. Scary for kids but fun scary..... the Lion King performance is great as well. Full on live musical show with lots for all ages to enjoy. Try not to tap your feet or sing along.... bet you can't. Both parades are great. Sit near the city hall to see them. Best view point. Get to the curb 20 30 minutes early to get a seat. Fireworks are good. Not GREAT but worth staying for. Ride the MTR home. Mickey has his own spur line to the park from the Sunny Bay station. Enjoy. Magical. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
467103755,3,2017-3,Australia,Was very small and as we didnt go on the school holidays half the park was closed but full price for tickets was still asked for. Not enough English speaking guides. Was left very confused not knowing what was said. To much was about mickey and mini mouse and not enough on the other disney characters. Unless the kids really bug you about going dont waste your money.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"467099250,4,2016-12,Indonesia,""I and family went to Disneyland HK this last Christmas (exactly on 25th Dec). As predicted, the park was full with visiotrs. Thanks God we have booked our ticket online before. This is a very recommended way to avoid the long queue on ticket locket especially during holidays. Just print out the online ticket and redeem your ticket in ticket machines available near the entry gate."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"467025852,4,2017-3,United States,""We have been all 6 Disney parks now. This is the 4th best but still fun to go see. You can do the park in 1 2 to 3 4 a day. The park opened at 1030am, but somem of the areas did not open until 11am, so you need to listed and plan accordingly. The grizzley Gulch coaster and the  haunted mansion   not really haunted but really cool   are a must see. Winnie pooh and Buzz were closed so that was a little disappointing. The simulator on Iron Man is a must do as well. The Space Mountain was redone to now have scenery that is like you are in Star Wars jet shooting at the Empire. Best Space Mtn ride of all of them. Its a Small World was even a little better as the scenary is different and includes Disney Princesses in each set, which is fun to find for the kids. Go early as there are multiple line checks to get in. Buy tickets ahead of time as 2 3 of the people that went thru security stopped to get tickets there."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466807543,5,2017-2,Philippines,""My first advice is for you to download the Disneyland App. Wifi is free all over the amusement park so even if you do not have mobile data, no worries. Having the mobile app is definitely a must.The app will show the schedule of the shows, where the characters are for photo op, it will also help you to go around the park and look for the attractions. Having the app will let you plan your activities better and you will not definitely miss or simply choose which attractions you will visit first.I recommend that you reserve one whole day of your vacation here at Disneyland alone.Fast track tickets are also highly recommended and plan on using it strategically :)Food and souvenir items are kinda expensive but YOLO so don't be too stingy and splurge a little bit.Every part in every ride is well thought off and the details in every attractions are all spot on! I feel that I am part of the story in every ride and attraction that we visited. The parade during the afternoon and evening are also a must see!But the most important thing that you cannot miss out on is the fireworks display. This will seal the deal. This will make every dollar that you spent counts. This will definitely bring you back to your childhood (and for me, it brought tears to my eyes especially during the  A Whole New World Song , I was even singing it on our way home and before I sleep)Your trip to Hong Kong will not be complete without visiting HK Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466787577,5,2017-3,Australia,""We went to Disneyland today and honestly in made me feel like a child again, so many different choices of rides and attractions to see. Make sure you stay for the night Parade and also the fireworks at night time as these are not to be missed. Dont waste your time waiting for the tarzan boat ride not worth it, i found this the most boring ride and longest wait time (45mins on a monday) in the entire place. Best ride by far would be the mine car rollercoaster followed closely by the star wars ride. RC rollercoaster in toy story land was also very good. A top tip would be to arrive to the lion king and mickey mouse shows 20mins early as they do turn people away if there are too many people already in line"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466702444,5,2016-12,India,""The Hong Kong Disneyland is one of the quickest ways to experience Disneyland. It is not as large as the other Disneylands but it give a good experience. If on a short trip or passing through Hong Kong with kids, it would be worth a visit. One day is enough to cover almost all the rides as the waiting time is mostly between 10mins and 30mins. The Disneyland is a bit away from Hong Kong city so it is recommended to travel by the special train that goes all the way to Disneyland station. Moreover that ride itself provides an experience as the interiors of the train features some Disney characters and even the train windows are customised in that theme. Tickets can be bought online and using the barcode in the confirmation email we can print the tickets using self service machines at the park entrance. If you are spending part of the time to take pictures with the Disneyland characters then it may take more time to cover the whole park as the queues for these photo sessions were long and most of the time the characters would be available in intervals only. It is worth waiting for the procession that starts around 7pm. Show is quiet impressive. Can be enjoyed by kids as well as adults. Later in the night there is a fireworks show which you can wait for if there is enough time. Recommended to visit the park during winter times to get a better over all experience. There are a few restaurants inside the park catering dishes from all over the world so there will be something for everyone. Overall it is recommended for kids including younger kids as it is quiet easy to manage them in this park. The latest attraction during my visit   The Iron Man experience was not yet open to public but was available for those staying at the Disneyland hotel. Probably at the time of writing this review it would have been open to public. The two hotels inside the park are relatively expensive and I don't recommend to stay there as it will also be far away from Hong Kong city making it difficult to travel back and forth. If only visiting the Disneyland then it's ok to stay there and experience it. I did not find any restriction for photography and equipments like tripod, monopod. But it will be better to use a light camera and multipurpose lens. During the evening fireworks or processions we can use the tripod if required. Until then lockers can be utilised to keep valuables and accessories. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466700461,4,2017-2,China,""when comparing the castle with the overseas one, the one in HK is  tiny  but the experience is also fun, nice, happy!   Good to see ShellieMay and Duffy here! I love Duffy!!!   Scrumptious foods.  Overall experience is fantastic."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466684720,5,2017-3,United States,""I LOVE Disney and I have the parks memorized in the USA. People have told me that the one in Hong Kong isn't nearly as good. I disagree. It is smaller, but very well done and rides are fun. Since it is smaller, there are not as many rides, but it is doable in a day. The day we went was not crowded and not hot, which makes a big difference. In USA, they open the gates early, however, they do not do it here. We got there an hour early and it didn't open until stated opening time. Food wasn't great. We loved the Toy Story area. So creative and different from USA. A nice day if you have done the sights in Hong Kong city."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
466545449,5,2016-11,United Kingdom,Visiting Disney was certainly a fun experience and it was interesting to witness a Disneyland as far away as Hong Kong! Obviously pretty similar to the rest regarding the rides however one thing we noticed was the lack of queues! Didn't have to queue for longer than 5 minutes on any ride   definite plus side compared to the American Disneys!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466489354,4,2016-10,Canada,""It is a place to be seen, beautiful and congested.Modern yet old, expensive but cheap on some levels.Transportation from the airport is as expected expensive as any big city. We use uber to get around and it was the most cost effective.Mass transit also works well and is reasonable to use.We did the combination of the two.Victoria peak is a.must see at sundown and evening. HK is stunning from there. Hotels are not cheap and rooms are very small by our standards.Food was surprisingly expensive in large restaurants but there are always fast food options!HK is a must see place if only once in your life."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

While we enjoyed the public train ride to the resort, it was overwhelming unorganized, as people pushed to get on and off and rushed to get into the park. All we can say is that we were here and one item off our bucket list. Here's to hoping Shanghai Disneyland will not disappoint."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"466191069,4,2016-12,India,""Hi guys, I have heard a lot about The Disneyland across the world but decided to visit HK and witness the show there being from India. First let me speak about the attraction and then the reason I chose to visit HK. I would like to specify that the premises is spread wide enough that you cannot cover the complete attraction in 1 day for sure even if you just play two games in one division (there are about 8 9 divisions in the complete attraction). Hence, I suggest that you book your accommodation along with the tickets for the attraction. First time visitors can definitely go ahead. I would like to inform you that you cannot carry any food into Disneyland. Only water from outside is allowed into the park. You have MTR service directly reaching the park from the mainland. You can also reach the park which is close to the Airport by bus and cab. Now coming to the reason for the visit to HK Firstly.... it is one of the tourist destination close to India featuring Disneyland, Second... it is a good tourist destination having lot of attractions near by like Macau and Shenzen. Third .... you get to have edible veg cuisine and a lot of sea food cuisine if you are in HK."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"466180948,5,2016-12,India,""One of the most amazing experiences i had. We took the tickets from Admirality MTR which were also discounted tickets. From clicking pics with Minie, Minnie, Goofy and the squirrels everything is fantastic. The ticket cost covers the cost of rides and one does not have to pay anything extra. Best parts include Toy land rides, Grizzly the bear ride. Take the Jungle River Cruise at night with fire and lights, railroad which covers almost the entire disneyland, Mickeys Phillar magic which is not to be missed   one can actulaay have watere drops coming on face! ";" Snow White which is must for girls, Geyser Gluch awesome, and many more. RC Racer is Toy land is not for faint hearted but awesome. Winnie the Pooh is for small kids but they will love it. Be here at least at hour before the opening hours to get the maximum rides as queues are at least for 45 minutes in rides. The Castle is beautiful and the entire place is fit for lots of pics. Its a good place for vegetarians and yummy food pure vegetarian food is offered in Tahitian Terrace. It is bit pricey but worth it. Large enough to give a fill. Night parade is a must and not to be missed. A must to visit place. Dont carry any baggae along as they charge a lot for storage. If you wish to buy then clothes in certain stores are of comeitive prices otherwise they are pricey. The Disneyland Metro train which takes you the land is beautiful and has the windows carved out as the face of mickey. Its a beautiful train. The last show which takes place as Disney in Stars is again not to be missed. The land closes after this show so make your way towards Mickey Metro rail which is the only option to move out of the place. In the last do not miss, Chip and Dale in Main Street, Snow White at Snow Castle, fantasy parade which takes place in afternoon at main street and festival of lion King. To see the entire place one has to walk a lot, so be ready for long happy walks"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
466167527,4,2017-2,Australia,This was out first Disneyland experience and enjoyed it even though it is obviously more targetted for families with small children. It had a  feel good  vibe and was a relaxing environment even with crowds,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"465928751,1,2017-3,Hong Kong,""Let me preface by writing we have been to Disney Florida and Disney California. Took my 4 year old twins to HK with me on business and decided to bring them to HK Disney as a treat. My children are biracial Caucasian Asian. I am Caucasian, mom is Asian.My son has light brown hair dark blonde hair and hazel eyes with some minimal Asianfeatures (e.g., no epicanthic eyefold so his eyes look more Westen while his bone structure is more Asiatic). His twin sister has a darker complexion and aside from medium brown hair eyes, she looks like a light skinned Asian toddler.My son was constantly hassled by Japanese and Korean patrons in the park, mostly obnoxious women between the ages of 30 40 years old who not only asked completely inappropriate and racists questions of my wife and I, but also thought it acceptable andOK to take selfies with my son. One of the women, a woman from Osaka, keptreferring to my son as  cute half breed boy. I put a stop to this after around the 8th or 9th Japanese Korean woman did this (mind you this was in the first two hours we were in the park). The final straw for me was when we went to a Disney stage show and the had an Asian woman made up in black face paintperforming a circa  1950's America  song a la Beans & Cornbread in front of a thousandlittle kids.Given the insane price of entry, small size and limited features of this Disney park, notto mention the  merchandizing attempts  every five feet and the profoundly racist experiences we had to deal with, I am crossing this off as a  we'll visit them again  place for the kids. The Ocean Park nearby is much better and nobody thought my childwas a park attraction toy for taking cell phone photos.I'd skip Disney HK and opt for the stateside parks. Maybe we will try Disney Shanghai with better luck."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yes it's not the biggest of the Disney parks, but it's great for a day visit or two. We went on the new Iron Man Experience which I didn't think was all that great, but Toy Story land is fantastic, great design and you feel like a big kid.

Plenty of refuelling stops, lots of merchandise to purchase relevant to the area theme and plenty of seats to sit and just chill. We had a 2 day pass and it was well worth it, to purchase the extra day was only $40, whereas if we had purchased a 2nd separate day it would have cost the full fee and believe me $40 is a lot cheaper than $480.

It wasn't overly busy so we didn't have to wait long. The only let down was the food which wasn't very pleasant.

"464390108,4,2016-11,Hong Kong,""One of the company's parks, it has many attractions similar to other Disney parks. The name, however, boosts the entrance ticket cost to high levels. Nightly fireworks display at 8 pm. Easy access by car or MTR train."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"464275471,4,2017-3,Indonesia,""Hong Kong Disneyland is considered small among other Disneyland. The bright side is you will only need a day to conquer all the attractions.Since mainland tourists of China also opted HK for a getaway, this place kinda packed and crowded even in a casual weekday. So I suggest everyone who plans to visit to start as early as you can.Oh the last, the price of meals and snacks here slightly cheaper compare to other Disney parks.

"464168930,4,2017-2,Thailand,""I went there almost the end of February 2017. Unfortunately, the weather isn't on my side, it was cloudy and windy (extra windy with Disneyland right near the seacoast). It took me 40 45 minutes by MTR to go to Disneyland (can be shorter or longer depending on what station is near you, mine is Yau Ma Tei station). I arrived around noon on a Friday, not many people yet (becomes crowded around 3 4PM). It is best to take the Disneyland train if you come in the morning so as you can see the whole park and know which you want to go first. For me, I went from right and circle my way around (my last ride being Grizzly ride). Oh, and I bought an online ticket for one day   plus one meal (589 HKD) from selected restaurant (cheaper than buying at the park). During the day, there will be several recognizable Disney mascots (mickey minney"; donald d; Elsa;" etc) going to different spots to take pictures). For those planning to collect them all, plan well! You can end up waiting 1.5 hours (seems longer with the cold wind) just to take a pic with one mascot. Ask the staff around the park when and where the mascots will be.As for the rides, there are several to choose from, my favs are Grizzly and Star Wars (all coasters!). You can bring a bottle of water in but doesn't allow food. Eat before entering as the price is quite high.One whole day should be enough to cover most of the rides and activities and parades and fireworks (and by whole day I mean from opening until closing) but two is preferable so as to not get too exhausted (lots of walking!)."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;

Rides were fun for both 4 and 9 y old, lines were'nt too bad, ranging from 5 to 25 min for a few, maybe the cold weather held away the crowds. Even the fast food was edible.

Mickey's Philhar Magic is a very good show and so is the parade. If you like fireworks then you should stay till the evening and watch the fireworks. The water splash ride is a lot of fun too. To get there take the Tung Chung (yellow) line MTR to Sunny Bay and the Disneyland train from there. Start early to avoid long queues and enjoy without much crowd.

How much time to devote? We did in a day with few misses, 2 days are suggested if you dont want to miss anything.3. Tickets? Better buy online, why stand in queue.4. Tip: Visit before you see Ocean Park.5. Are there rides for adults or is it kids only park? There are rides which adults can enjoy. RC Racer is only one for adults to give adrenaline rush. But still, it is a must, it is a different world.6. Food? Plenty of options for Non veg. For veggie found corn and few other stuff, nothing as a proper meals. You can carry dry snacks, fruits. We carried sandwiches and were asked to dump it at the entrance.Disneyland was one of the attractions we were looking forward to. Traveling by MTR is best option. Reach Sunny Bay MTR from your start point. From Sunny Bay there is another train that takes to Disneyland. This train is customized to have statues of characters inside it, windows are Mickey Mouse shaped.Once we reached there, we took the map and planned our stops. Meet characters on the way, there may be queue but do that. You wont find characters anywhere else. As per my 3.5 years old son,  meeting characters  was the best part of Disneyland.If you are planning to spend one day then you can skip   Jungle River Cruise section, not a must.Dumbo the elephant was surprising hot favorite. Cinderella Carousel is nice, Slinky Dog Spin was colourful and enjoyable for a 3 yrs old. We did most of the activities on the way. There is a 3D show too.The one thing which I personally liked the most and would recommend not to miss is 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' show.

I didn't finish the show because need to catch up the dinner reservation in the Enchanted Garden restaurant at the Disney Hotel. Buffet is really expensive, but worth the price for its spectacular extensive menu and dessert. Heaven for the sweet tooth. And the best of all, Mickey, Minnie, Duffie, Pluto, will come to take a picture with you.

Thankfully because the lines were pretty long and I can't imagine what they'd be like on a weekend. Even though they were long, they did go by quickly.The Ironman 4 D  ride  was great, as was the mine car rollercoaster. The jungle ride was silly and boring. We also took a ride thru the Magic Manor (I think that's the name) and it was cute. We did the tea cups and the parachute ride.As is typical with Disney, very expensive, but there were a lot of restaurants to choose from.

That may be a good thing if you only have a day and have small children, so you don't have to walk much. We were here for three days and it was bit too much time with too little to do. Also, the disappointment is probably more because we visited Paris Disneyland last year and Tokyo the year before, so in comparison, Hong Kong Disneyland pales. However, we didn't even need any fastpasses for any of the attractions as the rides weren't very crowded with all wait times less than 20 mins. We also caught the Lion King three times and the kids did they favourite rides numerous times. We didn't even use the priority pass we had for the iron man experience as the wait time was under 15 minutes. There aren't many thrill rides other than runaway minecart as hyperspace mountain is under refurbishment. If this is the first park you'll be visiting, then go for it.

The younger staff were full of energy and passion, which you could associate with in a Disney park. However, the good things stop there. There were quite a number of issues which could inconvenience your experiences at the park:1. Service from the older staff in supervisory positions are often a let down. They generally appeared to be cold and curt, displaying lack of professionalism and enthusiasm of those younger staff. For example, there was one supervisor (in white) at the Royal Banquet Hall who raised his voice and was pretty rude in his reply when approached. 2. Number of food options curtailed with several restaurants closed.3. A number of rides and facilities were also closed during the visits. 4. Numerous mistakes at shows such as Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. For example, singing was not in sync with the music and often out of tune.

Unfortunately the park just seemed to be missing the magical Disney atmosphere of most Disney Parks. The castle is far too small (but I believe there are plans for it being improved), there is no area for shows infront of it. The cast members were not as happy and bubbily as with other parks. The park has all the traditional areas and the rides are whole family friendly. We also booked a Private Tour through the park website which was amazing. Dani, our host, spoke fantastic English and was able to restore that Disney feeling that had been missing. The private tour makes you feel like a rockstar as you get to queue jump on most of the rides and get reserved seating in shows.

Several rides and attractions were genuinely top class and we were there as adults without kids...all of whom in the park seemed to be having the best time of their lives, particularly when the parade went past! The new Iron Man ride is awesome, especially as it's HK specific"; the Lion King show is very impressive;" Hyperspace Mountain is a wonderful example of how to update a ride to make it relevant after years and years. The racing car ride in the Toy Story zone and the runaway mining cart are also very fun, with short queues. ON TOP OF THAT, the western 'Coca Cola Cafe' on Main Street serves very good food.

So you need at least half day to visit this amusement park (I said at least).

"460511950,5,2017-2,Philippines,""It is indeed the happiest place on earth! My first travel abroad with my friends and of course Disneyland is a must on our itinerary. Feels like you are kid again. We tried almost all the rides and amenities there.MUST RIDE: The Iron Man Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, RC Car, Jungle River Cruise, RC Car, Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars etc! Cool breeze of weather since we visited first week of February. Food by the way is too expensive. Huhuhuhu. Souvenirs too but bought something just for me to remember that I went there. You can bring a water container because there are water stations in the area. Make sure you catch the Disney Parade at 3pm, Lights Parade at 7pm and the Fireworks at Sleeping Beauty Castle at 8pm.

The line up for photo with Mickey and Minnie at 2:34 minutes, well nice but not that nice.. Photo Pass cards with no photos to add to the collection, only 3 of 6 cards worked..so for a favorite stop in my passed, it's not shining like it used too...maybe Florida next time"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

459499473,5,2016-12,Hong Kong,Great experience. The whole experience is done so well from the music and sounds to all the attractions. The place is ultra clean as well which is very nice.

This was the secind time I've visited the park (the last being 6 years ago), and once again found the park to be much less crowded than those in other countries. The rides have been updated since my previous visit. I also love the special Disney themed MTR train that services the park."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"459483861,2,2016-12,Singapore,""Upon entry to the Hong Kong Disneyland, there were many restrictions.  No selfie stick allowed to be used inside.

Will not visit again if given the choice."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"459477169,4,2017-2,Singapore,""Disneyland is always a fun place to visit. Be prepared to spend your time and money there. The queues can be daunting for some of the attractions. You need to plan your visit properly in order to enjoy the whole park. Food and drinks is expensive inside. To get here, you need to take the MTR to sunny Bay Station and then change to the Disney Line. You will be amused by the design of the train."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
459460063,4,2017-1,Philippines,Smaller compared to Tokyo Disneyland but still fantastic! Went there on a weekday so lesser lines.

"459116075,3,2017-2,Uruguay,""If you have already been to Orlando Disney or EuroDisney, and you have few days in Hong Kong, it's not worth to visit because it doesn't have new different attractions.Therefore, if you have time and want to meet Chinese Mikey, it's a small but very nice Disney."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
459018481,4,2017-1,United States,We can walk from end to end within 15 minutes. The rides are about the same as any Disneyland but this park is small compared to the others in the US. Its still a nice day out for the little kids.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"458964471,5,2017-1,Australia,""Have always wanted to visit Disneyland and since Hong Kong is closer than the USA decided to visit whilst visiting Hong Kong. It was great, brother says smaller than the original US version but I did not care. A large amount of walking required but waiting times were very short on most rides and attractions. If you have grandchildren as I do, not a cheap place to buy gifts but then again it is a holiday. Took a tour that supplied pick up and return to hotel, much easier than having to get yourself there and home but that can be done via the MTR if you prefer. Fireworks are set off about 8.30pm, depending on the sunset of course so it makes it a very long day from when the park opens at 10am. Two parades are held daily, around 2pm and then again around 7pm but those times might change. A great day but wear very, very comfortable shoes."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"458955642,5,2016-12,Hong Kong,""This is amazing, wonderful experience that one should have at least once either with your friends or family members and or kids as kids really love this place as one can see all Disney characters in live when there is big rally then there are many fun and thrill filled rides and games. It requires 1 2 complete days to see whole of Disneyland. It's the only one theme park which is in Hong Kong and one of the biggest theme park, accommodating millions of visitors annually. So I really recommend that it's a must go and must watch place."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
458815455,5,2017-2,United States,Fantastic experience. Went on a Friday afternoon. Wasn't overly crowded. Longest ride wait was an hour. Sadly business doesn't seem to be too good as quite a lot of the eateries were closed. Place grew more crowded towards the late afternoon. Must stay for the fireworks which were fantastic. Overall most of the rides were good great. Must sit on the grizzly mountain and mystic manor ride. Would definitely recommend to all. Grab a churro on the way!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
458785876,3,2017-2,Hong Kong,Probably good if you are a kid and this is your first Disney trip but cannot compare this to the other Disney parks. Very small and lacks the true wow factor.

A staff member even advised us on how to proceed visiting the park as it was our first visit there.I tried to do as many activities as I could in around 6hrs. But I guess you need more than one day to enjoy them all.  It's a small world ,   Iron Man experience  and  Hyperspace mountain  among others are activities I liked. Some activities had many people waiting in long queues. So much patience was required.I really enjoyed my visit there. Hope to visit it again in the future."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
458628869,3,2017-2,Hong Kong,We went on monday so it was not that busy. Weather was great. Most rides unsuitable for our 3 yr old. The staff are mostly ok but we bumped into some really poorly trained ones with a lack of common sense.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"458439009,5,2017-2,Philippines,""Of course Disney Land is the best place for the young and the young at heart like us. If it's your first time in Hong Kong, do not forget to include this one on your itinerary most especially if you haven't been to any Disneyland before.The place can be easily accessed from any point at Hong Kong through MTR. Rides aren't that extreme after all this is a place for kids. But there were a few rides that pumped our adrenaline a bit. My personal favorites were the High Space Mountain, Grizzly Gulch, RC racer and the newest attraction";" IronMan experience.We also enjoyed the parade and really had a great time taking pictures and strolling around. We bought a Mickey and a Minnie mouse headband for the pictures which is a bit expensive as well as the other merchandise and food so be prepared, But overall, we had fun and indeed it is the happiest place on Earth."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
"458403607,5,2016-11,Philippines,""You can ultimately enjoy HK Disneyland in 1 day! Providing you come really early to avoid long lines in popular rides.Try these rides first: Space Mountain, Grizzly, and Adventures of Pooh. I know Adventures of Pooh sounds like a ride for kids only, but the lights and effects are pretty neat and magical! A soft ride, but the effects are really eye candy! Some restaurants were not opened when we visited. Better check out Hong kong Disneyland's website to see which restaurants are not opened and the schedule of shows for the day you will visit. The schedule will be available a week before your visit date.HK Disneyland's meals are pretty expensive. Ranging from HKD 99 to 200. I recommend getting a meal voucher on klook.com for a sweet deal. We used our meal voucher on an expensive meal and saved around PHP 200 .Churros and grilled squid are great! Ice Cream bars are okay. They taste normal. Popcorn was very sweet.The Parades are a must see! To get a better location, find a spot and stay there an hour before parade starts. :DFor those suffering from vertigo, Space mountain might be a little too much. But if you really want to try it out, avoid having a full stomach. You will get dizzy because the ride is poorly lit. I got dizzy and was on the verge of puking, so I avoided any rough rides for an hour or 2. You can go for the slow rides like the adventure of pooh and it's a small world. Eat something. You're ready for the next rough ride."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"458289389,4,2016-7,India,""It's definitely a must visit once in your life....this one is definitely not a large one....maybe one of the smaller ones but then that doesn't take away much. It has almost all the makings of a perfectly fun day for kids and if kids are happy then so wil the parents be. In my case, I was happy that the daughter was quite happy and excited but what was even more surprising in retrospect was that my wife remembered it very fondly and maybe even enjoyed it even more than my daughter, and hence the title.The rides are all included in the price, and there are quite a few of them all good for the kids for sure and very few that adults may have fun too! It is advisable that you carry your own food as it's expensive inside the park. Also, carry umbrellas and be ready for a long and tiring day as it's quite expansive. There's the option of priority pass that you can choose on select slides which is really good and must be explored."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

All the attractions were so much fun the kids loved it and then coming to parades disneyland night time   Halloween theme villan nights out   parade was simply magical!   We managed to catch up with festival of the lion king show which was   spectacular. We were not so lucky with meet and greet disney characters.. We did manage to get few snaps of various disney   characters   but missed quite a few tooo... The disneyland park did serve halal food so dining was pleasant experience. We booked our ticket through klook which included a voucher food voucher   so incase you are looking for halal restaurant you can visit Hk disneyland website for further detail on designated halal eatery anyway we ended our disney journey with a magical extravagant show of fireworks its was a perfect end to our magical journey Overall..

"457716578,4,2017-2,China,""Perfect family day out. For thrill seekers this is not the park for you as the more adventurous rides are still quite tame. It's not a huge park, which makes it easy to navigate. The shows and parades are everything you expect of Disney and check you map for the locations of characters for the memorable photograph.Food here is typically overpriced and catered to local tastes."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
457696129,5,2017-2,Australia,Great for the whole family. Easy to get around. A variety of places to eat for any budget.

"457507244,4,2017-1,United States,""Decided to take a trip to Hong Kong before Chinese New Year and took the kids to HK Disney. Kind of odd because we live about 10 minutes away from the original Disney in Anaheim. First impression, it felt like Disneyland. The decorations, layout, feel and employees all made it feel like Disney. The main difference was the crowd. We arrived early so didn't have to fight as much of a crowd. We took the boys on a few rides early, and was even able to get on the new Iron Man ride with minimal wait. It felt like there were more rides suited for young kids and less extreme rides, but since we went with younger kids, it was fun. We watched a few shows and felt that the shows were actually better in HK Disney than the Anaheim one. The performance wasn't necessarily better, but the overall compilation was better. Seeing that the tickets were cheaper than the US Disney and they had more food selections, the overall experience was not disappointing. Although, I did have to tell some guy off for not being able to stand in line correctly, and the best part was his lame excuse. But that didn't ruin our family time.

And we got lucky they open for public on the day so we can try to ride! The iron man ride was awesome!!Lilbit tips for you... you should try the Mickey magic show ( you should try to go at least 45 30mnt before the show since the show is soo famous! And it's child friendly and awesome show) space mountain and iron man show.I would miss this place and will definitely back again!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

457068506,5,2017-2,Australia,We have planed to visit Hong Kong primary to visit the Disneyland. The price was acceptable as we booked online and this offered us to pass the long ticket lanes. The kids enjoyed the park a lot as well as we. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The was crowded in some games but we have chosen to play the games with waiting of less than 30 minutes. We were not able to see the whole parts of the park. Must be visited.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
457048840,4,2017-1,Philippines,We arrived shortly after the opening and the first thing we did when we entered the park was fall in line for a picture with Mickey and Minnie of course! We went there on a weekday so it was not that crowded but the waiting time went as high as 40min. For a picture with Mickey and Minnie we had to wait in line for ~40min. The popular rides also had 30 40min waiting time. One day won't be enough so I recommend getting the 2 day ticket.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"457031885,4,2017-1,United States,""So, it is a very small Disney and people tell you that it can be accomplished in 4 5 hours. That could be true if you did not have to spend an hours in line for Dumbo ride, or to take pictures with the characters. I think if you get there first thing in the morning, before the gates open, it would probably allow you to do more. After 1PM, there is a long line for everything during weekends, or Chinese New Year. We got there at noon, and by then, the crowds were there. Also, despite how amazingly orderly everything in Hong Kong can be, one thing that the locals (and maybe mainland China visitors) are chaotic about is cutting in lines and just generally shoving their way around. It can get quite annoying. Many people spend a lot of time in the shops, it seems. What a great business to charge a huge entrance fee and then make the easiest place be the shops, where you spend even more. The Fireworks are really nice as advertised. Take the MTR to and from, but be prepared for huge crowds and being sandwiched in the train. It is like taking the public transportation after a sports even lets out."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"456879595,4,2017-2,Australia,""We arrived an hour before opening and were one of the first ones in the gate. We went on most rides straight away without any waiting. By midday most rides had in between 20 to 50 minute wait times. I think it was also in our favour that we went on a Thursday and not the weekend. This is a small Disneyland compared to the ones in the U.S and would be perfect to take young children. We walked the park 3 times around and went on most rides as well as having lunch and we left at 4pm. Getting to Disneyland was very easy by the mtr. We caught the train from Jordan to Lai king, Lai king to sunny bay then the Disneyland train."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"456718339,4,2017-1,Canada,""We actually stayed at the Disneyland hotel the 3 days we went into the park. they have a good transportation system to the park, the only downside is that it's a long walk to the entrance. I would suggest that they have additional transportation from the transportation hub to the gates, even if they charge. After all, there is nothing free at Disney.The staff greeting you are very friendly and courteous, despite the fact that they have to deal with unruly mainlander crowds.Surprisingly, almost all the staff had pin lanyards to trade pins with, which mainlanders don't know about yet, so bring pins to trade. I was told by a friend that it is only because it was CNY and they had to all show the pins due to higher ranking bosses making sure that they looked good during this Festive season.The parades are well organized and professional. access to characters can test your patience, as some. lineups, specially for Mickey and Minnie were running a couple of hours long. Best to check for times with their staff and get there early.The restaurants were many but be prepared to pay lots for little food as the norm at Disney parks.The stores were full of merchandise and no shortage of buyers.Their Ironman experience was new, but just a conversion of the Star Wars experience at other parks.They are opening a 3rd hotel, so no doubt the park will get much busier. A note if you are going around CNY, go on the first day of CNY. no crowds at all"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
456685669,5,2016-10,India,One of the best attractions in hong kong. Best ride is the mystic manor so make sure you don't miss it. Loved the lion king show.

Tarzan tree house is good, it provide views from the top over the rivers and parks. Grizzly mine was exciting and thrill (at least for me). Your kids probably will LOOOVE the toy story sections.

It was my sons bday and most of crew wished him happy birthday. He was truly elated with this gesture. Not to miss is the Jedi training, lion king show and the wondrous book show.

"455675907,4,2017-1,United States,""We enjoyed Disneyland Hong Kong. It is a fairly small park, but easy to navigate through in just a day, no need for multiple days. T it is easy to get to using the MRT. Disney line is clearly marked in all the stations (the pink line), and the train is very Disney oriented. It had memorabilia and Mickey hand holds   lots of fun for the kids to see. The rides were fun. Fast passes are only available for three rides: Marvel Experience, Hyperspace Tours, and The Winnie the Pooh ride. If you don't like  Asian inspired American Food , bring your own lunch. The Lion King show was awesome, but the crowd management is awful   only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five. They line you up to put you in groups, then it is a mad dash to grab a seat. Felt like Walmart on Black Friday. Get there early to be in the front to avoid the pushing and shoving. It needs to be more organized, but again, the show was great. Lines weren't too bad, and we went on Chinese New Year. They do a good job of letting you know what's happening around the park. Most employers speak English enough to help if needed. Prices for souvenirs and merchandise is comparable to US parks. They will let you pay with either USD or HKD, your receipt shows you both prices. Just be aware they are offering a lower conversion fee ( .4% I think). They do offer many  freebies  and deals with purchase that seemed to be a good deal. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Disneyland Hong Kong. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"455551136,3,2017-1,Germany,""One day here should be enough to get to see what you would like to see.Entry is about 70 Euros. You can take the MRT   about 6 stops from HK station.Get your Fast Track Passes as soon as you enter. Seems you cant take cans of drinks inside, but we seem to have been ok with plastic bottles.Download the app before you go   that was a huge help, as you can navigate around the park and the best feature was that you could see how long the actual wait time is for the individual rides.Avoid the hot dogs   probably the worst in Hong Kong, possibly in the whole of South East Asia. Drinks are pricey: a bottle of Coke will set you back about 4.50    .Some of the toilets were in a filthy state."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

If you've never been to any other Disneyland park you will likely be in awe and amazement of all the fun and wonder... But if you have been to another Disneyland park before, you won't love it as much. Don't get me wrong   it's awesome...but it's a lot smaller than most other Disneyland parks. The scenery is beautiful (there's mountainous hills behind the park which offer a really nice backdrop), and it does have some of the standard Disneyland rides (Space Mountain, the Tea Cups, It's A Small World). But it's not really a full day thing, especially if you're an adult. Having said that   it's still Disneyland! :) "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"455420823,5,2016-9,Singapore,""Going to Disneyland is easy for us, it will just depend on your arrangement with the hotel or inn your staying. For us we got the whole bus rented ,just for us ,going to Disneyland and it so much fun! We started the fun at 1030, be sure to get your ticket online, or purchased it already because queue is Super Long, for us as I stated earlier everything is arranged by the hotel, so everything is provided except for the ride home, it is either take the train or bus. It was really fun that we have tried all of the rides and attractions on this place, and be sure to take the map with you, actually we don't know their two versions of the map, we actually have the Chinese one, so all day we are actually reading the Chinese version, ( we know a little bit of Chinese but can't understand some) that's why try to find the English version which is provided in front after you enter the place. Their are food stores inside a bit pricey but I think if your hungry their nothing much you can do. At the end of the day is a fireworks and parade of the stars, try to go to the center for a better look for the fireworks and near to castle for the parade.they will start 7 pm for the parade then 8 pm for the fireworks.

"455237345,5,2016-10,United States,""As a long time lover of Disney, I knew I had to visit Disneyland when I started planning my trip to Hong Kong. I've only been to the two in the US, so this was a very different experience but definitely one that I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys exploring Disney parks. I thought the admission price was reasonable despite the park being so small, at least compared to the prices in the US. My husband and I visited on a Tuesday and the park was completely empty, we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for any ride and on most of them we walked right on without a wait at all. That being said, I really wanted a picture with Mickey and Minnie (they were dressed for Halloween!) but the line was gigantic so I skipped it, it was the only place a ton of people seemed to be congregating. We arrived right as the park opened and a number of the rides and sections of the park were still closed off for another half hour or so which I thought was odd, but we took that time to walk around and figure out where everything was. Since we got through the rides we wanted to do so quickly we only stayed for about a half a day but that was perfect for us. I was sad to see that the facade of It's A Small World was under construction so it was covered in tarps, but at the same time I realize that Disney is always updating and freshening the rides up, so it is usually to be expected. The real struggle we faced was that the rides seemed to be built for smaller passengers, my husband is 6'4  and was barely squeezing into some of the cars, the most difficult ride of all was Space Mountain. They put him in, what they said, the seat with the most leg room and we still almost had to give up and get off because he couldn't squeeze his knees in. He did end up wiggling in at the last second but was extremely uncomfortable and had a scraped knee by the time we got off. Other than that detail, the rides were great! We especially enjoyed the ones that are exclusive to HK, such as Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Manor (this is almost the equivalent of the Haunted Mansion). Since we visited during Halloween time there was a haunted house type of attraction but we were a little puzzled as to what was going on. There were live actors but no one was speaking English so we were just sort of following the crowd and trying to figure out the story line.. everyone who understood the actors seemed to be really scared though! All in all it was a great experience, definitely a must do for the Disney lovers out there. If you can, try to go early to mid week and get there for the park opening, you'll easily have a good view of the ribbon cutting which is fun to watch and it gets a little more crowded as the day goes on."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"455099287,5,2017-1,Norway,""My 6 year old daughter and 8 year old niece had a blast exploring the park together. It was heaven for them seeing their favorite Disney characters, trying the rides, and being so happy and excited just by being there. Since she is 115cm, my daughter got to try the Grizzly mulch runaway mine cars, which is the highlight of the trip for her    the ride is super exciting and made her feel like a  big girl . She was also amazed by the Lion King performance and has become emotional about the play. Like I said, just being there gives you that happy and excited energy. The park is relatively small and is very good for groups with small kids, maybe a bigger park would be overwhelming kids her age. it was a long day but I dont think we were ever tired.

"454226822,3,2017-1,Australia,""Disneyland was never going to be my cup of tea. I got a good deal on tickets from Klook, which lessened the pain somewhat. But it is still prohibitively expensive, especially when you add in transport and overpriced food and souvenirs. Even on a relatively quiet mid week day it was crowded and most of the rides had 10 30 minute waits. The kids maintained their enthusiasm reasonably well and perhaps there is benefit in teaching patience. We stayed for the best part of a day but only saw about a third of the park. If you are a Disney enthusiast, I would suggest two full days, especially if you are there during a busy time. In the interests of balance, I asked the kids for a different perspective. This is how it looked to the people that really matter :From my four year old son: My favourite part was hugging Mickey and Minnie and the Ding Dong train (Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad). My next favourite was the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride and the horsey ride (Cinderella Carousel). I even liked the new train that took us there (Disneyland MTR line). The dog one (Slinky Dog Spin ride in Toy Story land) was very scary. Eight year old daughter had a similar perspective: The visit to Disneyland was special for me because there is no Disneyland in Sydney where I live. I have never been to any Disneyland except this one in Hong Kong. I liked the Dumbo merry go round because you can steer it up and down. I also liked the Cinderella horse merry go round. I got on a big white horse that looked angry and fast. Then we watched the Disney characters go in a parade. The only thing I disliked was having to wait in line.

"454184230,5,2017-1,India,""One of the best place in Hong Kong to spend a day however if you have been to other Disneyland you might find this one very compact but definitely worth visiting however I come from India and I have not seen other Disney so it was great experience for me and my mother. If you are Asia and have not been to other Disneyland I am sure you will love it.Ticketing: Cost of tickets on Disney Land counter is for HK$589, if you buy it from any 7 11 it would cost you the same, I went to ticketing counter to see if they have got any promotional offer but there was not anything offer, you I installed  KLOOK  application and bought tickets for HK$497.Food: Food inside is dam expensive, half corn HK$100, Piece of Chicken HK$100 and if you are thinking of having meal it will cost you about HK$168 300 depend where and what you eat. I would advise you to buy the food coupon from Main Entrance Ticket Booth which cost HK$238 includes (Lunch   Dinner   Snacks) but there will be long queue so it is best to buy it from    KLOOK    for HK$80 for a decent size meal.Tips: There are many sites where it is stated they do not allow you to carry selfie stick so I did not carry it however its allowed carrying selfie stick everywhere except shows, also they allow you to carry water, biscuits, snacks inside but not meal so it makes sense to carry something specially if you are on a budget.

Now the bad, it is small the whole park is less than the smallest area in the Florida park. Most of the rides and things from the US parks will not be here. Look for 1 or 2 rides per area. The food is not like normal Disney food, more like poor quality street food. The items available in the stops is limited and double what the cost was in America the last time I was at the park.

"453216491,5,2017-1,Australia,""Ok. So the smallest Disney park. Yes. Some  attractions  are just statues. However tickets are cheap (full price were about $60 Australian. Bargain!) and some of the rides are unique to this park and awesome. Phantom Mannor (a updated and less  horror driven  version of the haunted mansion), Grizzly Gulch and Iron Man are all unique and very well done. Space Mountain is excellent here and has a great Star Wars theme applied. Very quiet when we visited, it might be less enjoyable if very busy but overal worth the few hours time to experience a genuine Disney quality attraction for a lower cost than in the US or Europe"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"452950320,5,2017-1,United States,""Spent 2 days doing Hong Kong Disneyland. It's a great park. Has plenty of rides for all ages & then with the parades & fireworks there is plenty to do. As we were doing 2 days in the park we actually bought a Silver annual pass (this is the same price as 2 single tickets). A silver pass only allows you to visit on weekdays (& even then there are a few other blackout days), but you also can use the pass to get discount of food, drink & merchandise in the park. So if you are planning on doing 2 days (that don't feature a blackout day) then you actually save a little bit of money."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"452911255,5,2017-1,New Zealand,""What a wonderful day! Well organised and a real treat. We were there on a Thursday in early January and the park felt reasonable quiet. Queues were minimal     no more than 10 mins for any ride. We walked around the park in an anti clockwise direction, which brought us to the area for the parade for 3pm. When finding a spot for the parade, you can get a better view if are not on an outside bend on a curve. The left luggage facility was very straightforward and could accommodate our huge cases. It is just to the left before the bag search areas which is just before the ticket desks. But bear in mind that it is still quite a walk from the transport drop off to the luggage office     so be prepared for the walk with your bags. Over all the day is expensive, but it is a unique experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I had a small issue with the online ticket I bought but there Guest Relations took care of me no different than they have done in the United States.I also had a Cast Member tell me to have a Magical Day.

Unfortunately it didn't have some popular rides such as the Matterhorn and Star Tours, but they did have Hyperspace Mountain. They also have a different version of the Haunted Mansion, which is a good experience.The lights   fireworks display was something different to what I have experienced before, as images were projected onto the castle which I thought was a very nice touch."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"452636125,5,2017-1,Philippines,""Activity: Disney has expanded from my last visit. Of course the latest is iron man which is really awesome (has a  free  tour around HK) plus exhibition of good to be true technologies, which kids and teens will love. Expect long queues as usual so plan ahead. If you want to ride as many attractions as possible, be at the site before opening as large crowd usually comes around noon. Suggest to take iron man, hyperspace mountain, lion king, rc racer and runaway mine cars as these where usually the long lines are. Watching parades is a must so suggest to be at the main street prolly 30 mins before the parade starts coz they attract crowd. The ending (fireworks display) is really a must see. This is where you will feel that you are a disney kid. Food: there's limited variety of food and they are really pricey (everything in disney is pricey). Try korean squid . Ticket: got my discounted ticket from klook which is very convenient and efficient. I avoided a long queue for ticket and went directly to the main entrance. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

They were excellent rides for me and my teenage daughter.The ticket booths open at 9am and the gates to Main Street open at 9:30am. The park itself opens at 10am. It was pretty quiet until just after lunch when the place became packed.If you don't mind splitting up, go in the singles line. You can get on a ride almost immediately rather than waiting for a long time in the queue. HK Disneyland has the same magical feel as Anaheim but it is smaller and there are less things for teenagers to enjoy. It seems a place more suited to families with younger kids."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

452338062,3,2017-1,Germany,the Hong Kong Disneyland is really small compared to other Disneyland and with not too many attractions.

"452236934,1,2016-12,Hong Kong,""My young daughter loves Hong Kong Disneyland so we went often. We've visited the park for 9 years continuously, and we were their loyal  Magic Access Card Members . But we   ve faced constant and repeated assault by other visitors, mainly from Mainland China. We   ve been punched, finger poked, hit by selfie sticks, pushed, stepped on, verbally abused etc. Each time the staff just watched, stood there motionless, and they took no actions. I've had 10 15 minute shouting arguments with people because they've either aggressively pushed me or my child, at times in  It's A Small World  and also  HyperSpace Mountain  where the arguments echoed loudly, but the staff do not help or call any security ! When I've complained to the staff (inside the  rides  or in their  City Hall )"; they refused to collect the details of the attackers and they did not call the police. In fact; they've NEVER called the police when I asked for their help ! They would say to me  It's a nice day why don't you enjoy the park and rides ! . I   ve sent emails to Hong Kong Disneyland on their security in the park but wthout real satisfaction. To force the personal security issue; on Saturday 3 December 2016 I deliberately took some goods in plain sight from the park   s  Emporium Shop  and walked out slowly until I was caught. It took them 15 minutes to catch up with me. I fully cooperated with the security staff, and I told them my reasons for my actions. My reasons being to high light the lack of personal safety and security within the park, and the fact that all of the security are concentrated in the shops to protect Hong Kong Disney's merchandise. When they caught me I was about to walk back to the shop and return the goods. I had NO intention of keeping the goods. In their INTERROGATION ROOM it was a HORRIBLE  Disney  experience. Harsh, nasty, no empathy, no understanding, a situation I found threatening because I was surrounded by three large security men. There was more security than all of the years I   ve been going there. The attending woman security supervisor ( a  Miss A    a name that sounds like a  musical ) did not care about my reasons. She refused to contact any staff to validate my written complaints. I told her whom to contact and which department, and she refused ! She stated it was another department ! She was robotic and bloody minded ! Her words to me were insulting, and dismissive for the reasons of my actions. She stated to me that they had policies and procedures to follow. I replied that her staff did not follow any policies and procedures when I and my daughter were attacked. She was silent on this. She stated Hong Kong Disneyland will charge me for  theft  and the police will escort me to the Lantau Police Station. She stated that I should take my young daughter with me to the police station because I will be there for a long time. I told her that I could not do that because it will SCARE her. She kept. on saying that  I'm an adult and I should reflect on my actions . That goes both ways ! She lacked the humanity and common sense to understand the reasons for my actions, and she wanted my child to spend hours in a police sation with me ! I spent 12 hours in a police station; and I left at 3am in the morning. Economic loss to Hong Kong Disneyland is ZERO (the goods will be returned to them). Moneatary loss to me will be in the TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars in lawyers fee's to avoid a conviction ! And all because I was concerned about personal security and safety in Hong Kong Disneyland ! It   s clear to me that Hong Kong Disneyland ONLY cares about protecting (and selling) its overpriced cheaply produced plastic goods. When I and my daughter were attacked NO security personnel ever arrived, but when anybody takes their goods without paying then there is an army of security. The fact that Hong Kong Disneyland wants to prosecute me for my actions shows the true nature and character of the company. Yes I REGRET my actions;" I was wrong to think so highly of  Disney  that they would understand my actions and the reasons for it. So much for a  caring  company. My daughter cried for several hours because I was in a police station, and my wife was immensely worried by Hong Kong Disneyland's actions against me. I was told,  by that woman , that I will be banned from returning for a year. Return there after this PHYSCHOLOGICAL TRAUMATIC  Magical Experience  ? HONG KONG DISNEYLAND WILL HAVE TO KILL ME AND DRAG MY DEAD BODY INSIDE THE PARK TO EVER RETURN !"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;

My only 3 negative comments about this place that some staff don't look happy (remember that is this should be the happiest place on earth), the queues to the show were not well organise (everybody was pressed up to each other and when the doors open there was a frantic rush) and announcements in English were so difficult to understand!

We did a quick train ride boarding at Main Street Station and briefly walk through Fantasy Land and Tomorrow Land. We did not try the rides in consideration of our ages.

We stayed for 2 days but could have done everything in 1 day.Only con is most of the park closes an hour before fireworks. For us, that meant the rides we planned to do were closed at 7 instead of 8.

Tips: 1. Bring an umbrella if you hate the sun 2. Bring extra shirt coz it's really humid and hot 3. Buy an express ticket if you're visiting on a weekend or else be ready to wait for 2hrs for queue 4. Better visit ocean park if you're traveling as a couple.

And to me i still prefer disneysea in japan. It is more for the kids and those challenging enough for adults are probably only the toy story and the starwars hyper space mountain which is fun. Also the grizzly bear roller coaster has a twisted surprise which I didn't expect so it was a good experience. I don't get the chance to watch the shows, sad. Because i had to take dad back to the hotel and return again to disney. Anyway we almost tried all the ride in just one day. Oh and the mystic manor is also entertaining. The one which you rode on a boat through the river is also nice to try. Make sure to stay and watch the fireworks. The buzz lightyear is also nice esp for kids.

Food was relatively good, no long waits. The shows were a great way to get away from the swarming crowds & hot weather. We spent 2 days going through, which I would recommend due to the crowds & being able to get your moneys worth on the rides. Plenty for the younger kids to do see.

"450617480,5,2016-10,United States,""Disneyland was great the magic is truely there when you walk in, we stayed at the hotel as well which made it even more magical, we didn't have to queue much for anything like rides or even to get in, the staff were friendly, the food fantastic, I recommend two days so the first day you don't take any photos and the second you do, just to give to chance to really explore what it has to offer, a good range of rides for all ages:) "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"450577855,5,2016-12,Philippines,""Who can resist Disneyland, really? It just brings out the kid in you, you know. We went on a weekday, and everything was perfect. Not so many people, and with the app, we were able to ride see most of the good stuff without waiting so long. Only things I really wanted to ride see but missed were the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop (waiting time never dropped below 20mins) and Mickey and the Wondrous Book (we came on time, but they're not letting people in anymore).If you're going to make a priority list, I'd say put Runaway Mine Cars, Hyperspace Mountain, and Astro Blasters on Top. Don't miss Festival of the Lion King and the Paint the Night parade, too.Food is expensive as expected, but you can easily sneak in a bar or two. Buy a meal voucher from Klook or another agency to save some dough.Oh, and did I say download the official Disneyland Hong Kong app? Do it!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"450543869,5,2017-1,Australia,""We went to Hong Kong Disneyland in Jan 2017. We loved it so much, although there are more rides for younger kids, and not much for the older ones. We still enjoyed our time. I did find restaurants to not have much variety for vegetarians, which I was really disappointed about. I would've loved a vegetarian burger, but settled for pasta. The fireworks at the end of the night were spectacular, and really ended our long day quite well. I really praise the cast and crew of The Lion King show   they did an amazing show and are exceptionally talented. I also really enjoyed the Tarzan boat ride around the tree house. Our boat guy was hilarious and made it enjoyable   I think his name was Lap or Lip. He did such a great job."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

450198847,5,2016-12,Philippines,My first time to any Disney park as i have been reserving my first disney experience at Disney World. Having a young kid can change your preference so i was left with no choice but to visit HongKong Disneyland and with the experience  im so glad we did! We visited on a Monday and we went early... surprisingly we did not have any issues with the queues. They were tolerable.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"450174414,3,2016-12,Hong Kong,""Compared to Tokyo Disneyland which I've been 8 times, this park in HK is lack lustre in terms of scale and more importantly, the feeling of warmth and happiness that it's supposed to bring to visitors.My 3 year old daughter eagerly queued and waited patiently for her turn to take picture with Elsa and Anna at one of the restaurants during lunch time. And she waited once again to speak with them when she realised that she forgot to ask them why they did not come to Singapore (a genuinely innocent question for a young child), during her turn to take photograph. She was only patronisingly acknowledged by the cast members and was ushered away without getting a reply from them. This disappointing response from Disney characters, who are known to be friendly and warm at all times, was actually rather appalling if you ask me. (P.s. The adults were not too impressed with their looks too, given that they were supposed to be pretty princesses.) My poor little girl kept asking me why they did not answer her and wore a sad look on her face for a while, until her next meeting with Donald and Daisy outside the Emporium at around 2pm.This time, she was turned down yet again when she offered M&M candies, which she just purchased from the shop, to them. This was easier to explain to her cos they were working and they did not have a real  mouth piece  to consume food.Overall, the experience at HK Disneyland can be improved if they really want to pride themselves as the happiest place on earth."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"450161015,4,2016-12,Australia,""Good theme park for kids and adults of all ages. Plenty of rides to choose from.We stayed in Disney Hollywood Hotel which has a free shuttle bus to the Disneyland Park itself. We went after new year on weekday and the average waiting time are 20 30 minutes, probably the new Shanghai branch lured people out of HK branch, plus in Asia most schools started around the 3rd Jan. The hotel itself is designed in old theme Hollywood Jazz era of 40s 50s?Weird, the hotel does not have any room service so we had to go down to one of the restaurants. Given the location is a bit way out nowhere it wasn't easy to get out and about unless you took taxi, or the shuttle bus to MTR station, and another train ride into town."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

449880464,4,2017-1,Canada,We were here in early January after the public holidays so it wasn't crowded. Most rides were less than 20 mins wait. It's so small.

Good selection of rides and also other attractions but everything easily covered and we did not arrive until lunchtime. Food also very good. I had an excellent lamb curry at Mystic Point . Also very easy access by MTR from Central and at a bargain price ( HK $ 54 return fare ) . Well worth a visit all considered . "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"449804083,5,2016-12,India,""It was my 6 yrs old daughter's dream to meet her favorite Disney stars. To be honest, my HK trip was Disneyland centric alone as places like Dubai have better tourist attractions than HK. We booked Disneyland tickets via Klook a month in advance and availed good discounts!Reaching Disneyland is so very easy... The HK Disneyland is located on the Lantau Island near the airport. You can either take a Disney Resort MTR Line, a taxi, a public bus or a coach. We stayed at Panda hotel and it took less than 45 min for us to reach there.If you are travelling by MTR, change for Disney Resort Line at Sunny Bay Station. This is a direct dedicated line to the Disneyland with a frequency of 4 10 minutes. Bus R33 (to Tuen Mun Railway Station) and R42 (to Tai Wai Railway Station) operate 20 minutes after the fireworks display. In Sundays and public holidays, Bus R33 and R42 run from Tuen Mun and Tai Wai to the Resort Public Transportation Interchange at 09:00, 09:20 and 09:45.The Disney Resort Line is a themed MTR train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and comfortable sofas. This MTR brings you straight to the Disneyland station from where you can walk up to the entrance counters. The queue starts almost 1 hour before park opening. Your vouchers are converted to regular tickets only through the entrance. Being a small park it can be seen back to front in nearly 5 hours. Wear comfortable shoes as you have to walk a lot and stand in long queues at times. As someone suggested here already, consider going deep into the park to Adventureland or Tomorrowland and then work your way back     you   ll skip the crowds and queues will be shorter. I had clearly read here that visitors head straight to the character meet and greets near the entrance when the gates open and the queues build there up pretty fast... However with a 6 year old dying to meet her favorite characters i too didnt have a choice but to add to the queue :) Light snacks were allowed without any fuss inside the park. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Own water and juice was allowed too. The free WIFI service inside the park was good enough for us to share our memories in real time. Ensure to check out the time and place of the meet & greet of all the Disney characters from the guide map available in the park's entrance. Each Disney character is out only for a short time (approx. 30 mins) so get there early or you won't get to meet them. The food at the restaurants wasn't too attractive or delicious however we still had a heavy meal to stay active until the fireworks. We were free in the evening but were eager to stay till the Paint the Night parade and the fireworks. So we grabbed the best seats on the benches right in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Even though the weather looks pleasant ensure to carry warm clothes during winters as staying out in open for the shows can give you a wind chill effect. I personally found the oe day ticket to be good enough as we with planning we covered everything and enjoyed nearly 99% of the attractions. I used the fast pass for Space Mountain and one more ride and it worked like a charm, no long queues :) Though everyone says DON'T BRING SELFIE STICK which i even confirmed with Disneyland team, i could still see a lot of guests with these sticks inside the park. As suggested by someone here i took an autograph book and got many characters happily sign it. My daughter went gaga over our idea and is still very thankful. Thanks to my dear Tripadvisor friend for that suggestion!Keep enough space and charge on your cameras phones for videos and pictures until the fireworks as you would love to capture every moment for a lifetime. Disneyland is must visit for people of all age. My wife and i enjoyed the Cinderella Carousel like kids... The video recording still brings smiles to our faces :)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"449798423,4,2017-1,Indonesia,""This is HK Disneyland we're talking about and not much to see and play for a thrill seeker. Better go there in the afternoon and wait until the fireworks flare the sky at 6 or 8 pm.But still too many visitors make you have to queue more than half hour to its top attractions.Some of quite amazing rides are space mountain, jungle river cruise and mystic manor.Enjoy the sparkling surrounding and its quite fascinating decoration during festive Christmas and New Year."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
449769320,5,2017-1,Australia,Getting there was easy via MTR. Great day out. We covered the whole day in the one day. Blessed with LOW wait times of no more than 15 mins so very happy we did not purchase fast passes. Viewed the lion king show no problems. Take cash for food as they do not take Credit card... we have done Disneyworld in Orlando and found this less stressful as the park was no where near full. Only it's a small world was closed for renovation. Light show parade and fireworks were worth the wait.Tip   train closes at around 530pm..,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"449654704,5,2017-1,United Kingdom,""I'd heard mixed things before coming to HK Disney and as a big fan of Disney parks  we've done Florida and Anaheim in the last 18 months, I was worried that this small park would fail in comparison. But to my delight this was not true.There is enough familiar to be Disney but enough different to delight. I loved the it's a small world that includes Disney characters. Where we in other rides spot the country, here we were hunting the characters! Look out for our favourites, the 3 cabelleros! We were so lucky the Iron Man ride had just opened and this was awesome. As fans of Star Tours, we were familiar with the concept. But still found the ride a thrill!Apparently the park is always quiet til lunchtime. We certainly found this. We queued for nothing till around parade time 3pm. So arrive early as you will feel like you have the park just for yourself.The shows  Mickey book and Lion King were up their with the best Disney park shows I've seen. The Lion King is different to the Animal Kingdom one so not to be missed. The parades  again, up there with the best. I particularly loved the Electrical Light show just before fireworks. We had no problem having good viewing even for my 4 years old. He danced the whole way through!I was surprised that the retail experience was not as huge as I thought. Ok, I might be comparing to WDW but I had thought the Chinese would be up on the whole Disney merchandise?! What was really different was an absence of Disney t shirts other than on western visitors. I feel out of place without my Mickey T in a US theme park. Here I didn't see a princess,pirate or personalised family party at all!I love Chinese food. But my one suggestion, and my one fail was to try traditional Chinese food on my family at Disney. This is not the place to experiment on them! Stick to what you know they will eat   to boost up their energy levels and hit the park!And consider doing 2 days if you are a real fan. We were there all day and missed a few rides that we went back a second day to do, even though there were no really long queues."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It did get busier as the day went on, but everything was bearable (I think the maximum wait we had was about 20 minutes during the peak of the day).I've visited most of the other Disney Parks throughout the world, this one is noticeably smaller. However they had plenty of  meet and greets  with the characters throughout the day, and lots of photo opportunities! We managed to get our pictures taken with atleast 4 different Disney characters during the day.

"448414552,4,2016-12,Australia,""Last year we visited Disneyworld in Florida with our 8 year old in June and its huge offering would have needed a full week to enjoy. This time our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland over Christmas was a lot more relaxed. For one thing the Park is far smaller, more compact and less crowds and lining up. Also the weather was perfect, whilst winter, it was a mild 21 degrees most days. I wouldn't recommend going in June which in Hong Kong (like Florida) is just stifling hot and humid.Disneyworld is easily accessible by MTR from Hong Kong central. After two days we had been on most rides. Thankfully the new new Ironman ride had a soft opening and it was great, incorporating the Hong Kong skyline into the ride with great effect. The other rides were good and our 8 year old had a great time. There is a wild Star Wars roller coaster ride as well but not much else of Star Wars other than the Jedi Training academy and a lot of merchandise. The evening fire works also were fun.The great thing is for an Australian, Hong Kong is only 9 hours flight away and in Aussie time zones compared to the US with both Anaheim and Orlando big flights for kids.We will now only go back to Disney once the new Star Wars worlds are open in the US, that will be worth travelling for!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Everything is bilingual (Cantonese and English), friendly staff. We went during the week, so the lines were shortly, only had to wait 20 30 minutes per ride, at most.The Star Wars additions in Tomorrowland were outstanding. A must see. The Ironman experience is a motion theater, not bad for a 10 minute way, may be a bit of a disappointment for an hour or more wait.Great holiday parade at the end with an outstanding fireworks display.Easy to get to with the MTRs.Would definitely go back."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

But please take note they strictly prohibit the use of selfie stick. This is my dream place for a pre wedding pictorial.One day is not enough to enjoy the place. No long lines, only 5minute wait with all the rides and attraction. Explore first! Don't shop at the first two hours of your stay in Disneyland.It is expensive, we expected that so we wanted good service. Maybe it's the culture thing but the staff could be more polite. It looked like it hurts when they smile. It's better to download the app before visiting the place than go find help in the information area.

448249285,3,2016-12,Canada,If you have visited Disneyworld in Florida you may be disappointed in Disney Hong Kong. The castle is underwhelming to say the least and the place is quite dirty. Many attractions close by 2000 even though fireworks are at 2100. The positive was that there was not the crowds at all that Disneyworld sees and so no waiting for rides. (Longest was 30 mins) and that was rare. My teenagers rode hyperspace mountain 7 times. I am a huge Disney fan and so was glad we went however would not go back. ( I have been to Disneyworld 5 times and would return).

The park is advertised as open til 9pm.In addition the parade takes place in total darkness and you can't move around freely for fear of falling in the dark or being robbed. This is a danger for both older and younger people.We did approach the Disneyland staff to complain about the price of the tickets   given they were charged at a full rate  with no after 5pm rate applicable and only portion of the park available to access.

The park is easy to get to by MTR and has its own dedicated line for the last bit, you can even buy your tickets at the MTR station before setting out and beat some of the queues!

Fast pass is useless since all attractions took less than 30 minutes waiting. For the Star War ride, by the end of the day, there was no line up. My kids and I had three rides back to back.

Well, the longest queues you will ever stand for, losing your time. Oh and then the dirt on the floor, I will not even go into details, because it is quite disgusting to be honest. The overpopulation in the park and the mass of people make the trip unbareable to be honest. The huge dissappointed and specially when you know Disney Paris, Florida or California...

"447973308,3,2016-12,Philippines,""The name  Disneyland  makes you all excited about what's inside, about the facilities etc etc, however, Disneyland Hong Kong provides little to no excitement at all. It is very small for a theme park standard, it has limited number of rides and most of which are, although very child friendly, boring. The scenery however, was extraordinary. They perfectly captured the essence of every theme, some themes however, somehow gave the impression that they were minor attractions basically because there were little to no rides in them at all. Having said that, I conclude that the Tommorowland attraction is the best, especially the buzz lightyear ride, really fun, lined up thrice for that ride."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Frequent opportunities for pictures with characters.  Loved the main strip... especially the afternoon parade. Don't miss that!!!! The evening fireworks are great. We went for Christmas and they even shot out fake snow onto the main strip. My little girls loved that.  Decorated well for the season. Cons: Price! So expensive. Nearly everything costs something. There's a lot of commercials, too. They make you exit via gift shops. That's common for a park, but not after individual rides. You'd think the high price of admission would cover other things. But I guess that keeps away the masses.  it's DisneyLand in Hong Kong. Where is Mulan?! Seriously, Disney... how was this overlooked? Maybe she's in ShangHai, now that they have a park there.

More than anything else Disney parade, fire works, Chris tree lighting and meeting you favourite Disney character is an experience in itself. If you have a young kid then you are going to have a fielded day. One day is not sufficient to cover all fun. We visited it for 2 days.

I was especially pleased we got to try out the brand new Iron Man ride, which was slot of fun. This park is superior in the sense they had much more content available in English as compared the the Japanese parks.However we quickly came to realise the park is particularly small! I would say after three hours or so we'd seen the whole park and all the attractions we were interested in.The place is well run and we'll staffed. But for the very high ticket prices they charge, I'm not sure three or four hours is value for money. The twin Japanese parks give you slot more bang for your buck.One other note was the stupid prices for food inside the park. I guess one should just expect to get gouged for everything at a theme park, but they seem to have mastered the art at HK Disney. A very average and plain cheeseburger cost $26 AUD. I paid less than that for a burger at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! So if you remember, bring some stuff with you."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

But this has almost improved version of each ride we have been to the USA disney parks Wonderous Book show(new show) is awesome and must see. Lion king is equally impressive. We have a 6 year old and he could qualify for all the RED tagged roller coasters. He just fell in love with the parade and fake snow right afterwards in the main street area. Do the most desired rides early to avoid crowds and do take fast pass for the ones where you hit long lines.

After all, Hong Kong has been in the service industry for a longer time.I found the service of the staff unfriendly and in no way giving their guests a magical day. We were asking for directions and the staff will just point and say the name of the place. I know the name of the place, but I am expecting more details like turn left or right and when.... and in the midst of me still trying to get more details for direction, the girl went to answer the phone! I was so disgusted by this unfriendly and rude attitude. Disneyland definitely need to buck up on training for their staff.Another girl showed up to apologize, saying she was supposed to man the stand but comon, everyone wearing a Disneyland staff uniform should be helpful and not just because it is not her stand she can be so rude!Anyway, after experiencing the Disneyland in shanghai, I will just recommend everyone to forget the one in hongkong and go shanghai instead."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The cheerful vibes are contagious! We had a blast on the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, Slinky Dog Spin, Orbitron and HK Disneyland Railroad that goes round the park. We also visited Chewbacca & R2 D2 at the Star Wars Command Post located at the Tomorrowland. We skipped a few of the popular rides due to the crowds.Food & beverages are more expensive along the Main Street area, we bought 3 medium sized fried shrimps with chips for HKD48 at the Lucky Nugget Saloon, Grizzly Gulch after our visit to Toy Story Land.

There were a lot of people from China and a few from Hong Kong, some from the States, and Europe. The people from China, kept cutting the lines, a few times I had to say,  Hello, do you not see us standing here? , Another place we were waiting to see a show, and there wasn't any indication of where line started and ended just all people standing everywhere which was really horrible. All the Chinese pushed it was a bit crazy, and foreigners looks at each other like Oh My Gosh and we were all laughing even though we don't know each other. I would not recommend to go during summer, too hot. Choose a cooler season. Wear sun screen if you go during summer, might burn a bit. Food there was delicious, we had a few coffees to cool us off, we went during beginning of May. It is different than the one in USA, or China. Best to go there not during Chinese holidays otherwise, too many people and bad behaviours. You can buy the food there, it is not crazy high prices, and have water since you will be standing in lines to get in.

The only thing we didn't managed to do was to catch and take a close up photos with all the Disney characters due to the timing that's scheduled.In terms of transportation, there is a direct MTR from Hong Kong station to Disneyland, which you have to interchange at Sunny Bay and you will come across a Mickey Mouse decorated MTR trains to Disneyland. It is advisable to go during weekdays when it is less crowded compared to weekend. Also, with me at my second trimester pregnancy, most of the rides are pregnancy friendly with one or two rides only.

Rode the good rides: Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars in the Grizzly grunch, and from Toy Story land: toy soldier parachute drop and RC racer7. Just in time for the 7pm Disney Paint the Night8. Tomorrowland's not so awesome Hyperspace Mountain (No sudden drops, just swinging fast) and a photo ops with Star Wars characters9. Disney in the Stars fireworks. Be sure you bought your MTR singe journey ticket to avoid the Disneyland closing time queue, especially if you don't have any Octopus."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"446627152,4,2016-12,Singapore,""The kids and I were glad to see some Star Wars attractions and rides at Tomorrowland and slowly taking over it, but also relieved that Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters is still around. We enjoyed blasting away at the Zurg that we had to take the ride twice! Hyperspace mountain which has you in a X Wing evading Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters was just too thrilling   it's twists and turns, and sudden drops and stops are not for the faint hearted! A crowd favorite is the Slinky Dog Spin   we managed to try it this time, but not in our previous 2 visits to the park as the kids were younger then and did not have the patience nor the stamina for the 30 minute (at least) queue! For the Christmas festive period, there was a Christmas tree light up and fireworks in the evening as well!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of the things in disneyland is mostly want to attract kids so mostly are for kids but for a 19yr old me, I really do love it. The most unhappy thing of this trip to disneyland is where before you enter, they will need to check ur bags. The girl call me to throw the fried rice i had in my bag away because I cannot bring in. My mum is a vegetarian and disneyland doesnt have vegetarian food so the fried rice i bring is in case she is hungry but she call me to throw. At last I throw but I am still mad at her for making me throwing it. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

They will shout Instructions and man handle you if you look like Chinese. Or course if you are Anglo Saxon they treat you differently. What a regret that we choice HKG as the destination for our 2nd Disneyland visit this year. Tokyo was way way way better.

"446487156,5,2016-4,United States,""Maybe this review is bias because I love amusement parks, Goofy, Minnie Mouse ears, fireworks, and I was proposed to in front of the castle. Hong Kong Disney is wonderful! The magic begins before you even arrive to the park. If you take the train, you are picked up by the Mickey Mouse train which is decked out in Disney decor and playing all of your favorite Disney tunes. You also get to dote over the cute little girls dressed in Disney princess wear. Adorable! Mickey tells you to have a magical day and you automatically decide that you will.We stayed at the resort which is amazing in and of itself. The shuttles to Disney are frequent and convenient. The rides are fun and totally make you feel like a kid.You must see the fireworks show at the end of the night. My lovely fiance proposed to me under the fireworks and I loved it! My dream come true!

Farcical entry method, we bought tickets on line and then proceeded to wait in line for half an hour or so. Various other problems resulting in a wait of 1 hour. Crowded place and difficult to battle your way through. Food expensive, basically you get ripped off. Very few places to sit down and watch the goings on. Saw two parades which were quite good but not the place I would go to again."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"446386997,5,2016-12,United States,""I am a vacation club member with Disney and have traveled the world with my membership, but this was the fist park I have been to outside of LA or Orlando. I couldn't have made a better decision. The hotel, park, transportation, service, food, etc has been most excellent. I am visiting from East Africa and this is such a breath of fresh air for my family. This place is pristine and very well taken care of. It is what I expect from Disney and they have not disappointed. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"446283256,5,2016-12,Singapore,""First, we booked Hong Kong Disneyland tickets via Klook. It is definitely cheaper than buying through Disneyland website. Plus there are discounts for first timer users of Klook. After buying through Klook, we received the vouchers via email, printed them out and brought them on our trip to HK. Reaching HK Disneyland, we headed straight to the main entrance turnstiles. The staff simply scanned the QR Codes on our printed vouchers and in we went. It was very fast. While the Hong Kong Disneyland is small compared to others around the world, the atmosphere was great and the waiting time of the rides weren't that long. I really appreciated how Hong Kong Disneyland is the only Disneyland with a restaurant serving halal food. As a Muslim traveller, halal food can be hard to find at times. While the prices for the food are steep, I truly appreciated that they serve halal food at the Explorer's Club. For a standard meal, it costs HK$139. All the rides were okay, nothing death defying. Kids would enjoy the rides more. Personally, I was there for the Disney experience rather than for the rides. Two noteworthy rides are the Grizzly Gulch and RC Racer. The Lion King show is a must watch. The show was impressive. If you want front row seats to the show, you need to be there in the queue one hour early. But regardless of where you seat, you'll thoroughly enjoy the show. In fact, sitting too close to the stage may not do you good for a positive experience. Do go for Disney's Philharmagic 3D Concert. As the name suggests, you'll be given 3D glasses to put on for the show. Get ready for the experience as you'll feel the wind in your face, and the splash of water (Yes! we got a little bit wet from the sprinkle of water during the show). I thoroughly enjoyed the Parade at 3.30pm and the 7pm Parade. It was then that we saw all the Disney's characters. Do seat at the parade grounds early. Like literally seat on the ground for an up close view of the parade. People were already seated on grounds along the Parade route at 2.50pm. The fireworks at 9pm were also just as great. The music and the images on the castle added to a great fireworks display. As we were leaving and walking along Main Street USA, they released snow from the rooftops! It added to the magic of the Disneyland experience. Amazing time!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

446163616,4,2016-12,Singapore,Great theme park though small. Park is still maintained in good condition. Stark Iron Man attraction in Tomorrowland due to open in Jan 2017. Universal Studios Transformers ride is much better than Iron Man ride. More realistic and effects. Some attractions are conducted in Cantonese. Need to check the timing schedules for English sessions. Lion King and Mickey's Wonderous Book shows are good and the theatres get filled rather quickly.Hope to see more attractions added soon to justify the increase in park ticket prices.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"445864176,5,2016-9,India,""Disney land as the name says is one of the biggest theme park. It is a must visit destination, well connected via MRT in Hongkong. Take a map to visit all its attractions like Fairyland, toyland, star wars and many more in the list. Few essential things to pack on your way to disneyland are water, sunscreen, umbrella and sun glasses. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes as you need to walk a lot inside. It has many fun rides to enjoy and everything is worth the ticket price.

"445787865,5,2016-12,Japan,""We literally just arrived back at our hotel from our trip to HKD and it was fabulous. We went on a rainy Wednesday in December. First, the longest wait was 20 minutes (RC Racer and Slinky in Toyland). Second, the park is rather small, which makes for shorter distances between rides  although I still logged 15,482 steps. Third, the rides that are unique to HKD are actually REALLY cool. In my opinion"; Mystic Manor is much better than the Haunted Mansion. Hyperspace Mountain completely incorporates Star Wars into the ride, which is fun. And Big Grizzly Mt. Runaway Mine Cars (insanely long name) was this amazing combination of Thunder Mt, Aerosmith, and Everest! All with less than a 5 minute wait. As with most Disney properties outside the US, the food and souvenirs are more reasonably priced but the food can be tricky if you have picky eaters. English is spoken widely and fluently. Oh and there are stickers for the kids to collect;" just ask the staff. We took our family of 5, ate a full lunch, had several snacks, bought a custom lightsaber, sweatshirt, t shirt, pack of socks (it rained we had wet feet), a few other small items, and the grand total was right at $500. Not bad for Disney. Bottomline: I wouldn't advise traveling to Hong Kong FOR Disneyland, but if you are here, and can go on a weekday, go for it! You won't regret it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;

Better to be seated at 5.30 pm as it becomes very crowded at 6.The live shows ( Lion king, etc), Mickey 3D show are worth watching. Fast pass is mainly for Meet and Greet characters.

Super time!The only thing I need to warn about is the food. Generally the meals here are extremely expensive. We had our lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant and it cost us almost HKD600 for just 3 sets. One set was around HKD180! And it was horrible food. We had our dinner at Plaza Inn and the food was a thousand times better and the the price more reasonable.

This time we took the baby brother as well.It's easy to reach by MTR which includes a great purpose built train that kids love.The park fee is not cheap allowing you enter to rides. There are some rides only suitable for holder bigger kids but those for younger ones are sufficient to keep them busy for the day.Lines can be significant. In our last visit the most we waited was 30 minutes which was ok.Near the attractions if you are lucky you'll find the action figures to greet kids and grownups (Buzz, Darth Vader, etc) Disney characters are also around.You can find several restaurants that get really busy and food is... fast food. Some more than others but in general, from the 3 I tried you will not remember the day because of the food.In general it's a nice family outing, particularly if you don't go during summer) despite being a bit expensive."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Pros:   Mystic Manor and Grizzly Gulch, both are rides not found at other parks. They are well done and fun.

"444393278,4,2016-12,United States,""Let me preface this review by saying that I've been to Disneyworld in Florida more than a few times, and my review of Hong Kong Disneyland will be compared to what I'm familiar with in ways that may not be fair.We purchased the  Play and Dine  ticket online for $539 hkd, a special offer that includes a combo meal along with regular one day admission. When we went to pick up our tickets we were told that we did not qualify for the lunch voucher because we had booked the ticket from a Hong Kong IP address. There was nothing in the terms and conditions that excluded booking the ticket from a Hong Kong IP address. After a very unpleasant 15 minutes of arguing with guest services, we were finally given our lunch vouchers. The vouchers were good for up to a $139 hkd meal in either a standard or Deluxe Restaurant. I'll come back to this later in my review.Getting to Hong Kong Disneyland was really quite easy. We took the MTR from Jordan Road Station, with one transfer, finally arriving at Sunny Point. At Sunny Point you can catch the Disneyland train right to the park. Once you get off the train it's about a 10 minute walk to the entrance gate. So the trip is both convenient and pleasant. We have the Hong Kong octopus MTR card and it cost about $20 hkd for the entire trip, so its also affordable.Once inside the park the first thing we noticed was it is on a much smaller scale than Disney World in Florida. I would guess that the park is about 25% the size of Disney World. Knowing that the lines can get very long we immediately headed out to the most popular ride, Space Mountain. In Hong Kong, the ride is called  Hyperspace Mountain.  There were no lines and we were able to move through without any wait. To beat the crowds we proceeded from Space Mountain to the other more popular attractions namely, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, Mystic Pointe, and the River cruise. Again we found no wait.After seeing the main attractions, we had lunch at the Explorers Club in Adventureland. The food was expensive, small portions, and of cafeteria quality. There were no lines and no problem finding a table to sit. The combo meal was $139 hkd.At 3 o'clock the parade came through. The Disney cast were able to keep everybody organized, with those closest to the street having to sit down so that the row behind them on the park benches could view the parade. This was a very nice touch.Overall the day was enjoyable, but if you're expecting a theme park similar to that found in the US you won't find it here. The attractions are on a much smaller scale, with a fraction of the detail that went into the park in Florida. Highly recommended."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Be young again!!You will be full filled your children mind here by all Walt Disney's cartoons you grew up with.Gingerbread Latte Coffee at Market House Bakery is a nice start.There are many theme parks you should try. What I recommend are  Mickey & the Wondrous Book     Philhar Magic     Mystic Manor   I don't think  Space Mountain     is a good choice. It's too dark, too shake. You wouldn't see anything inside, just feel to be shaken. And you must try  Big Grizzly Runaway Mine Cars       . I am so sad not trying it because it's closed at that time.There are many cafes  restaurants. I have a dinner at Disney Land Plaza Inn Restaurant ($720 for 2 Included with exclusive view of fireworks*). The meals in the courses are Chinese style with a glass of Mocktail, Grape & Pineapple with Soda, which is soooooo good!!*A dinner course with the exclusive view of firework, they will bring you go to the zone at the middle of Mickey Mouse Circle for the fireworks show.

Hyperspace was good and at least you could get a time to return to ride rather than wait in the queue. Several of the rides were closed and the Ironman one hasn't opened yet.

Young kids enjoyed the Jedi training session but too bad there was age limit applied. However, my kids loved the rides and enjoyed themselves in the park especially in Tomorrowland (hyperspace mountain), Grizzily Gulch (runaway mine cars). We found that the staffs are generally friendly and proficient in English Mandarin. The park is well maintained and still magical! When I accidentally fell down and hurt my arm, the staff on site responded fast and sent me to the first aid room to receive medical treatment. The paramedics were nice and professional."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"444158562,4,2016-12,Malaysia,""The tweenagers enjoyed the place very much. I am prone to motion sickness but was caught by the urges to go for the rides early and avoid the queues. It was not a smart move since I was giddy for most of the day after riding the Star Wars rollercoaster. The tweenagers complained of giddiness and heaving stomaches but in 10 minutes were ready for the flying saucer. The storybook show was really lovely, Tarzan tree house was fun. Had lunch at the halal restaurant  oversized servings and for Malaysians with our currency, it was ridiculously expensive. Similarly for the souvenirs, twice what we would have paid two years ago.The tweenagers went for other rides while I watched. I would have liked to see Lion story and paced myself for more rides.

That being said Disney HK is a good place to go with kids for sure, but ideally it should be done on a weekday unless you want lots of pain and go on a weekend. I can only imagine the waiting time in the rides on a weekend given the over all size of Disney HK. You have to spend a day here to get to ride all the rides for sure. I also suggest not doing this on a hot summer day, late November is good as it is sunny but cool.

The lines for the very few baby rides disallow strollers and clearly not one of the designers has ever tried to stand in line for 40 minutes with a toddler! Apart from It's a Small Small World , the shows and rides are frightening, especially in   dventure land, so you are reduced to the Fantasyland area where there are two main rides, that are almost impossible to access. Surely strollers can be parked at the end of the queue and not at the beginning? Also impossible to shop as there were too few cashiers and no one to assist on the floor, forcing clients to save questions for the cashier, thereby delaying the lines even more as the cashier had to run around finding correct sizes etc."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

When we queued to enter, I was shoved and nobody seemed to care that they had pushed someone. I mean.. what's the rush if everyone got a ticket. The facilities were decent and I thought they would have been good if they attracted more civilised culture to the area. Toilets were beyond gross and wet. Food was decent, but I would rather fly to Japan for their Disneyland than fight it out with this bunch here. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"443631429,5,2016-12,Australia,""I have been to Disneyland, Anaheim multiple times, plus also to Disneyworld, Florida twice. I was worried the HK Disneyland wasn't going to be up to standard or have the Disney feel I love, but I was wrong. It's really beautifully done. The MTR ride to the park started the Disney feel with Mickey windows in the train! The Christmas decorations were even more beautiful than in Anaheim last year. Sure, it's a smaller park but two new areas have recently been added and soon there will be a new Ironman attraction, which can't be built at the US parks due to franchising issues with Universal. Newer areas: Toy Story land   great for smaller children, and Mystic Manor   Glitter Gulch. The Mine train type ride (similar to Big Thunder Mountain) was fantastic and also had a backwards second! Mystic Manor is a cross between the Haunted Mansion and Indiana Jones. Food was typical of a Disney park. They were popping caramel corn all over the park so everywhere smelled like sweet caramel...lovely. The live shows were all excellent as was the afternoon parade and the fireworks. Unfortunately due to two spots of rain (literally two spots only) they cancelled the evening Paint the Night parade. Can highly recommend this park   also seniors over 65 only pay HKD 100 entry (about AUD 20.00) Nice for extended families."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"443316998,4,2016-12,Australia,""I wanted to visit this place for a while now, finally I had the opportunity to visit it and I can say that I was quite pleased. Before I came here, my friends said that this disneyland is small compared to other disneyland. But I think that there is a lot to do and I did not cover even half of it in the whole day I was there.As soon as I entered the park, I saw the train ride. It takes you from one station to the other. I did not do any rides as there were lots of big queues for them. I thought that the shows here are what sets disneyland apart from other theme parks, so I aimed at watching as many shows as possible. If you had time to watch two shows then watch the Lion King show and Mickey's wonderous story (they are both musicals). They are a sight to behold. There is also a parade at 3.30pm and another at 7.30pm. Both are definitely worth seeing. The magical day ended with a fireworks show outside the castle at 9pm.The people are very helpful in Disneyland and if you need help they will go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable. Before entering the park you have to go through a security check where they make sure you are not carrying any food with you. They prefer you eat their overpriced and greasy food inside the park. There are a lot of greasy and sugary options in there. Not a lot of healthy options and basically no vegetarian options other than potato chips.

"443271383,5,2016-12,Australia,""We took the MTR to Sunny Bay station then caught the Disneyland train (make sure you purchase a ticket for this part of the journey). The train has Mickey Mouse shaped windows and statues of Disney characters. It's a great way to start the day. We visited on a Tuesday and arrived just before 10am. There was only one couple in front of us purchasing tickets so we didn't have to wait. We bought two day passes as we knew we'd need more than one day to see most things. Although you're inside the park they don't open the 'worlds' until 10:30am. We started with a couple of the rides and only had to wait a maximum of 10 minutes. No need to get the fast passes for the Hyperspace Mountain ride but it's still worth getting them in case it gets busy later. We saw the Lion King stage show which was excellent. The park offers plenty of different dining options. The food quality was OK but overpriced for what they served. Don't take your own food though as they'll confiscate it before you enter the park. There's lots of different retail outlets selling everything Disney but make sure you're prepared for the high prices. The mine cart ride at Grizzly Gulch is the fastest and most exciting ride. We re visited two days later in the afternoon after spending the morning at the cable car (they're on the same MTR line and one station from each other). We did most of the rides again, more shopping and stayed for the night parade. I didn't think that would impress me but it was worth staying for. As part of the Christmas theme they had fake snow falling from some of the roofs on Main Street which was a nice touch. We decided to beat the crowds and left before the fireworks at 8pm (seen one firework and seen them all!). This turned out to be a good move as the Disney train was only half full and everyone got a seat. The MTR back into Hong Kong was very busy both days. The Ironman ride was still under construction and the RC Racer ride was under repair (December 2016). If you want to go on the circular train ride the last train runs at 4pm (as we discovered at 4:01pm). Plenty of things to do for the young and young at heart."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I was able to quickly walk through all of the areas (I skipped it's a small world, been there  done that!) in just 90 minutes!!! I also got there shortly after they opened on a Monday, so it was not super busy which was great. It cost about $70 USD, and if I had been there all day, it would have been a fair value. There were a couple restaurants closed and a couple rides closed, that's why I gave it 4 stars. The rides I decided to go on, I had a mere 5 minute wait, which was great, no need for the Express Pass! Most of the princesses characters had no more then 15 minutes wait time, some I were able to just walk up to and get a photo that quick!! The longest line was at opening for photos with Holiday Mickey and Minnie  I would guess it would have been about an hour. For those who have been to DisneyWorld  the main Castle here is Sleeping Beauty's, so it's MUCH smaller. Also, TomorrowLand is MUCH smaller as well.

The attractions are mainly for kids and even the 'most extreme' are never so exciting. Some of them were under maintenance and the 'soldier parachute' was still being tested at 12.00pm which is unacceptable for those who pay a 1 day ticket.The worst was Star Wars attraction which is basically nothing compared to the Transformers attraction at the Universal Studios. They only used some projections and lights, no high speed, no 3D or 4D effects!If you want to take a picture with Disney characters you have to queue for longtime..why don't they hire more staff to represent Disney characters and let them walk around so everybody can have the chance to take a pic?? At Disneyland Paris we took a lot of pics and the characters walked around at any time! I love Disney world but I think this Disneyland should definitely improve."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"442059288,5,2016-3,Thailand,""Took our young family to visit the magic kingdom in Hong Kong. I think went during off peak season so everything was just right. Queues to the rides were minimal, so the kids were able to go multiple times on their favourite ride. Recommend you get a lunch meal plan as this incorporates some savings. Will go again. Although it is the smallest Disneyland it is perfect for small kids who are on their feet the entire day. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"441835146,3,2016-12,United Kingdom,""I finally made it to a Disney attraction after 43 years and thankfully nephew and niece made it fun. It was a fun day out and wish we had longer to take in more. The only downside is the price. Overpriced entrance fee and food was way too expensive,   23 for burger, chips and deeps fried prawns with chips. Mc Donald's make a better burger for a fraction of the price. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jedi Performance is must watch. Don't try the Space Roller coaster, you will regret ha ha... my heart is almost thrown out. Face turn pale and hair stand up.

"441534512,3,2016-11,Singapore,""Comparing experiences from Paris and Tokyo Disneyland:Atmosphere is duller compared to Paris and Tokyo. It would be nice to be able to see a list of all the character meet and greets somewhere on the website. Go on a non public holiday, school holiday to miss the crowds. We went during the week on a Thursday, rides were also abit of a wait (30 1hr) For a family with a toddler this is hard. There is a fastpass but with a toddler only 2 of these rides are applicable.It was warm, there were little shade for some of the rides when queuing up. Ended up only going on 4 rides as we wanted to see the parade at 3pm and some of the theatre shows. One of the theatre shows was half Cantonese and half English. Micky speaking Cantonese just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe for some it might.Shops and Disney paraphilia is good. I'm a bit shocked at the lack of beautiful Christmas decorations on sale, it was a little depressing to see that compared to our visit at the same time in December to Paris, where there were walls of beautiful Christmas decorations.Cons:UHT milk on sale at some food vendors but not coldFood is not tasty, a little disgusting compared to typical foods you can get in Hong Kong. it was also expensive for what you get."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
441489367,3,2016-11,Singapore,Having been to other Disneyland locations  HK Disneyland is great for young kids but not preteens or teens. There are 4 exciting rides   of which 2 were closed for renovation. Many things were closed such as restaurants and eating stands. And the facility is old. The merchandise here is fairly boring and repetitive. Shows are highly recommended though  and worth watching (regardless of age). Food is decent. And take note of the hoards of tourists   as they might get rowdy during parades and closing time. Parades are really fun to watch and the staff are generally quite friendly and helpful. Would not recommend  it's a small world   don't bother and visit other parts of the theme park instead. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

441335072,4,2016-12,Singapore,First visit to disney hong kong with my young kids and parents.The atmosphere does seem abit lacking as compared to disney tokyo probably due to the scale of the theme park. On the positive note queues for rides are fast in theme parks terms (no more than 10mins wait for rides during my visit) hence we get to experience all the attractions we wanted to during the visit. Weather was fantastic too.On the negative aspect will probably be the quality of the food. Food quality was pretty bad considering what we paid for thuo the serving was big.Taxi is easily available when we left at around 5.30pm as compared to the older theme park in hong kong.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For groups it is perfect, even when the amount of thrilling attractions is not too huge, beside the 2 rollercoasters there are only a few other funny attractions. For kids it is perfect and they will really enjoy it.

441061698,5,2016-11,Philippines,it is our 4th time to visit disneyland but first time bringing an infant. the parks gets improvement everytime we visit along with the increasing price for food. it is a bit expensive and the water sold is  mineral  i was unable to find distilled water for my infant inside the park. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
441031118,5,2016-11,United Kingdom,Great place to spend a day if you have a little more time in HK (we were there for 10 days). This is a small Disney park compared to the others round the world; it still offers all the usual Disney fun... but without the masses of people and huge queues. We had a great day.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;
"441018328,5,2016-11,Australia,""This is a fantastic resort to stay especially if you wish to visit the HK Disneyland. The rooms are awesome, they were set up with Mickey Mouse and balloons when we checked in. Try to book a room on the higher floor to get better view. Also try to request ocean view rooms. The breakfast spread is awesome and the experience itself is amazing with disney characters like mickey mouse visiting your table and entertaining your kids. The resort is nevertheless away from the city so not ideal if you want to visit attractions in the city as well, although there is a shuttle bus that connects with the MTR station in the HK disneyland. If you are at the resort, consider spending all that time in the resort itself and visiting Disneyland, then move to the city for another night or two. There are no shops   cafes   restaurants near the resort so the only lunch   dinner options are within the resort and the food is very expensive in the resort, so keep that in mind when you plan the travel."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
440992655,5,2016-8,Australia,We had a great day at Disneyland. It was my wife's birthday and we were treated well.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The park still looks new and is spotlessly clean.  Highly recommend Disneyland HK.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"440991121,4,2016-10,Australia,""Very easy to get to using public transport. We went there on a Monday, Halloween and thought that it would be very busy. However it wasn't too bad. Getting there was super easy, just a couple of train rides and you're at Disneyland Station. We got there a little after 12pm and still had plenty of time to do all the things we wanted to do.The lines were pretty quick, the longest time we waited was about 30min for Mystic Manor as they had technical issues for most of the day, so when it did re open everyone wanted to go on it. But it was worth the wait, different from the other rides I've been on. Download the app as it will shows you with the wait times for the lines and help you plan your day better. Even though we got there a little later in the day, we were able to go on all the rides we wanted to, got to watch the shows and parades and had a very leisurely day. No running around trying to fit it all in, so going on a weekday was a great idea. We stuck around until the fireworks, which were amazing!The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the cost of the food! Very expensive, but then again most attractions are."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"440986638,4,2016-11,Australia,""We first visited on a Friday afternoon and pretty much walked on all the big coaster rides. Grizzly Gulch was fantastic and we really enjoyed Mystic Manor. The night time parade was lovely and the fireworks fantastic. We found the cast members pretty friendly. The Lion King show was spectacular. We returned on Sunday and naturally it was much busier but we still rode Spacemountain and met R2D2. The rides for the young children seemed very long   we were lucky to go on the Pooh ride on Fri night after the fireworks which enabled us to only wait 15 mins. It is pretty much shoulder to shoulder here on a busy day and the shops are insane ! I don't know where people get their money from to spend so much!! Lol. We have visited Disneyland and Disneyworld in the USA and of course HK is much smaller but it was fascinating to visit a diff Disney all the same, especially an Asian one."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
440867872,5,2016-11,Philippines,Plan ahead. Watch the 3 and 7 pm parade. Get a two day pass. 1 day is not enough to watch and do all the rides and show.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"440832915,5,2016-11,Philippines,""We lucked out as the day we decided to visit the park the weather was gorgeous. I picked up a one day pass for everyone online so it was one less line to deal with at the park.Getting there, the hotel staff recommended we just take a taxi as prices seem to be under control and it was a lot less hassle. We took their advice and getting there involved zero stress or guesswork. From Kowloon to the park was just under 200 HKD.We were dropped off very close to the main gate and while making your way to the ticket counters you will have a chance for some photos. We got there about 11:30 and it seemed many people had the same idea even though the park is supposed to be open at 10am.First checkpoint was a security check for bags. Besides the obvious things they look for they also search for selfie sticks (monopods) as they are banned in the park. While we are on that subject, make sure you bring a phone charger or extra batteries. You will be taking loads of photos and video. Bring more than one picture taking advice as murphys law will dictate that the single unit you bring will have issues.Once past security we made it to the line to transfer your online tickets for real tickets. While in line we got to watch a number of folks having arguments with the security personnel about what they could bring in.Tickets in hand we made it inside and the first thing we see is the train station. The train will depart the entrance and go non stop to the top of the park and you will have to disembark. If you enter the train at the top of the park you will get a one way ride back top the entrance and again forced to disembark. Knowing what this train does can help you plan your park excursion.There were three major events we enjoyed. The Parade at 3pm another parade at 7pm and the fireworks at 8pm. These are must see events that just about everyone will enjoy. Get to the parade route along the  main street  area and get your  seat  on the curb at least half an hour early if you want front row action. The fireworks will be held at the castle so try and get positioned front and center to the castle to really enjoy that one.Another tip. Many of the disney cast and characters will set up photo opportunities at  random  times in appropriate places such as Alice by the teacup ride. This is a great opportunity for folks to get pictures with their favorite toons. Please keep in mind the toons need breaks and frequently we found ourselves in a line without a toon as the staff did a poor job in some instances to let the queue know who would actually be last so prepare for disappointment. Supposedly the toons take breaks from 15 30 minutes so if you time it right you can catch them again as they set up.If you are very pleasant and have a genuinely friendly outward demeanor, you may be able to convince some of the random  cast members  walking through the park to take photos with you. Even the people who play toons that are not famous still enjoy the opportunity to take photos with guests. Ask nicely and you can get some great opportunities. Another unknown bonus that was available are the free disney stickers that many toons, cast members and park staff will pass out. Even people working in the stores will have stickers to hand out. Again be nice and you will most likely be rewarded with a sticker.One oddity that we discovered were the Disney girls who seem to visit the park frequently, dress up and constantly pose all over the park for selfies (using smuggled selfie sticks). We are not sure if it is just a thing or if they are hoping to find the future Mr. Right. The ladies are friendly and pose no issues.We picked the month of November for the perfect weather and a regular day of the week to avoid school crowds. Our waits in line were rarely more than five minutes and we never really broke sweats due to the nice weather. Keep in mind this is still typhoon season in asia so you could face some rains. Give your self a few days to get lucky or plan to get a little wet. We think you will still have fun.OK the park and rides themselves are fantastic. I am not going to do a rundown of the sections or rides. I will say the roller coaster in the back by the mining operations was awesome. The Alice Tea cups are always a favorite. It's a small world boat ride is a winner. We also did what I believe was the raft ferry across the river to visit the tree house ala Tarzan. Back in the day it would have been Swiss Family Robinson. The Tarzan area does have some interactive activities and great photo opportunities.There is food and shopping everywhere. Shopping is all overpriced. There is no getting around that. Food in Hong Kong itself can be pricey but in the park even more so. I will have to recommend you avoid the fast food garbage like hamburgers and hot dogs and stick with water and real food. Sticking with the healthy option will likely help improve your chances for a pleasant day. When the fireworks are over, the staff will gently guide you out of the park. If your quick and nimble you can skirt your way past many of the visitors as they tend to lollygag on their way out. We did the beeline, avoided the subway train tour busses and were first in line for a cab. No waiting. We had a wonderful time and the staff was awesome despite dealing with a remarkably high number of ill mannered guests. These same guests will pose a challenge to your patience as well. It will not take you long to figure out who to avoid. Have patience as some cultures have an unusual view towards public politeness, manners and courtesy. Other than these few obstacles the park is wonderful and I wish to thank the Disney leadership for making it such a smooth running operation."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"440782144,5,2016-11,United States,""We were debating if we should use the last day of our holiday for Disneyland and so glad we did. If you like Disney, even if you have been to the other parks, you will probably have a good time. (We have been to Disneyland in California, Florida and Tokyo. And, we had a really fun day at Hong Kong Disneyland). If you have been to a Disney park before, one full day is enough. We were there for 7 hours and did pretty much everything we wanted to. (Would have liked to stay longer for fireworks, etc., but had a flight to catch). We went on Sunday, November 27, a sunny day, and the lines were not bad. Compared to lines at other Disney parks, these lines are pretty short. (Fast Pass only for Winnie the Pooh and Hyperspace Mountain). But, you need to plan your time.We checked in and left our luggage for the Airport Express station in Kowloon, went to the park on the MTR and then straight to the airport on the MTR. Only took about 40 minutes from when we walked out the gate to when we walked in to the airport.While similar to other Disney parks, it has it's own special things. The Festival of the Lion King Show was excellent.Mystic Point is unique. Grizzley Gulch Mine Cars was unexpectedly good.There are discounts available, so purchase in advance. We booked on Klook and got 10% off. Also saves waiting to buy tickets."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
440772909,4,2016-11,India,Super time spent with family. Tickets were pre booked (advisable for all tourists else there are long queues for tickets).

Kids loved the rides even though the new Ironman Experience hadn't opened when we were there. Not to miss! ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
440560483,4,2016-11,United Kingdom,A good tip is to get a two day ticket in advance as the queue at the park can be long. You have to be quick on your feat if you want to do this in one day. Check out the shows they are good. 3 big theatres. Take food with you as the meals are   10 each coke is   3. There is a bag search before entry for alcohol but normal drink and food are allowed.

"440323737,5,2016-11,India,""Disneyland is not to be missed especially with kids. Be sure to take a stroller because there is plenty of walking and stroller parking outside the activity areas are available. It is best to take a 2 day pass if you have the time because to cover such a vast area in a day is not possible. The queues for photos with Mickey and Minnie are huge... You get a photo pass card wherein can log in online and view the photo and buy it (keep in mind till you dont buy u cannot even download the photo!) Its a small world ,  Winnie the pooh ,  Mystic manor  are the attractions i really enjoyed. Even the  Cinderella Carousel  was awesome. The queues are huge but the good part is that the wait time is displayed outside the ride so u can decide if u want to go or not.Try and go on a weekday because weekends are super crowded. The parades are beautiful and the firework display is also not to be missed. You can access Disneyland from Tung Chung MTR and also bus stop is there.If you staying in the Disney hotels then the shuttle bus goes every 5 7 minutes. Even if you but tickets in advance and get the soft copy, you still have to queue up at the ticketing counter to get the entry pass.Look out on the Disney website for deals and discounts... the one day pass is for 539 HKD and i got a deal of 599 HKD for a 2 day pass.. so do remember to check for offers.There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops.

"440138517,5,2016-11,India,""Very nice place for not only children but adults too. Be there before 10 am so that you can enjoy as much as you can. As it is impossible to see all the shows and rides in 1 day so for 1 day ticket people go as early as possible. If you have more time you can buy ticket for 2 days. The gates open by 10 am. Take one umbrella if possible on sunny days summer specially. Nov to March is the best time to visit. If you have small kids and before taking any ride (specially quicker ones)you are not sure of do check with the guards as they will not tell you anything without asking. The food is good if you are non veg (eat specially beef and pork) not much for vegetarians. The prices of food inside are quite high. But at the end of the day its worth(try their bakery).

"440034098,4,2016-11,Philippines,""Went to Disneyland Hong Kong again last November 2016. What can I say? There's just something about Disneyland that makes you feel like a kid again. Wife's eyes lit up as soon as the train to Disneyland arrived at the station.Let's begin with getting there. Getting to Hong Kong Disneyland is easy. Use the MTR. Just be prepared for a couple of train changes.For the tickets, we would recommend purchasing online to avoid the long queues. Just present the printed tickets or mobile vouchers at the turnstiles for a quick entrance.There are a couple of shows one shouldn't miss, the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The production values for the Festival of the Lion King is awesome! Definitely worth a watch. Just be at the attraction 20 30 minutes before the show starts to get good seats.As for the rides, they were just okay. Not really that exciting. Understandably, most are geared for the younger kids.Food...lots of food venues. Most are catered for the Asian diet (rice, noodles, etc) but there are some Western dishes as well (burgers and steaks). Restaurants can get pretty crowded during lunch time so either eat early or late. Obviously, everything costs a lot more. A few dollars can be saved by buying a ticket with food package online.There are 2 parades, one at 3pm and the other at night. These are also cool. There was also a Christmas Tree lighting ceremony around 6pm. Mickey and the rest of the gang sang Christmas songs by the huge tree in Main Street.During our first trip years ago, a huge fireworks display would light up the sky around 8pm. This was accompanied by popular Disney tunes. Unfortunately, it rained a bit during our most recent stay so the show was cancelled.Disneyland Hong Kong does not compare to the other Disneylands. The park is smaller and the attractions are simpler. However, it's still an enjoyable experience for the kids and the kids at heart.By the way, avoid going during weekends and holidays. We went on a Friday and it wasn't so bad.Would we visit again? If it were just the wife and I, we'd probably skip it since we've already been there a couple of times. However, I'd take my son as soon as he's old enough to enjoy the place."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

439914428,5,2016-1,Indonesia,I visited Hong Kong Disneyland on January 2016 with my daughter and sisters. This is my first time went to Disneyland and I love everything there. Well this is really a place  where adults can be child again..,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"439837661,5,2016-11,Australia,""This is an amazing place to spend a wonderful day. The train carriages to get you there were just beautiful. There were no long lines waiting to get in and the cost is very reasonable. The staff were very friendly but a few did not understand us. We spent all day there and stayed to see the night parade and fireworks which was well worth it. The night parade was even more spectacular than the afternoon one. There is an abundance of rides to choose from and everything is so colourful and clean. We went on a Tuesday and the children (and adults) no trouble at all getting onto all of the rides they wanted to. I think the children even went on some rides twice. Disneyland is not to be missed if you have children while in Hong Kong. A little tip   take water, the price they ask is ridiculously expensive. Places to eat are okay but nothing special."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"439812083,4,2016-11,United Kingdom,""Thought things would be a bit more dramatic, i.e. 'Disney', but it was a little low key. Not many bigger rides either but fine for our 2 year old. Worth going but doesn't beat Florida or Paris."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"439740316,4,2016-3,United States,""Beautiful place, beautiful living characters, great rides and staff on the rides were friendly   which is rare in the city. There were so many baby strollers. I've never seen such a massive stroller parking like that before.Many good deals at the Merchandise Stores. We bought a lot of stuff from three different stores. There was no problem at the two stores, but this one store: everytime we asked for 3 4 shirts in different sizes they ALWAYS brought the wrong ones. When we corrected they seem upset... Wow, If you can memorize it maybe try to write it down next time. Still from the same store: there were misunderstanding at the cashier since the staff didn't understand English well. We tried to tell them that we haven't got one of our item yet, they thought we wanted to buy one more item with discount (should buy 3 for discount). The 'Supervisor' was screaming a bit, and showing unfriendly gestures. She really lose it. When they finally understood, she just put the item into the bag without saying anything and still put on the unpleasant expression.If you can't be nice and friendly that's fine  we used to it after traditional market experience anyway   but at least be professional!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
439673835,5,2016-11,Philippines,It's really the happiest place in Hong Kong.

"439642435,5,2016-11,United States,""My first time to Disney here in Hong Kong. It was spotless and it was quiet thanks to the Disney in Shenzhen that opened. I would highly recommend this to anyone. the number of workers almost equal the number of visitors, absolutely no lines whatsoever, walked right onto each ride and was able to see the entire park in one day. Absolutely wonderful. I've been to the one in Florida and California and this was spectacular in comparison to them simply because there was no waiting and it's brand new."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"439620128,3,2016-11,United Kingdom,""It is amazing how dated and run down the Disney brand has become.

"439619338,2,2016-11,China,""More like a big merchandising area with a few attractions for kids from 3 to 7 years. No real roller coaster, actually no attraction for people older than 12 at all. But my boys, 2 and 4, had fun. Queuing was OK, because it was off season. The rides mostly took les than 2 minutes, the time in between the rides was much longer... It wasn't painful, but if you expect a similar experience to european or US theme parks, then it is disappointing."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"439518994,4,2016-11,United Kingdom,""Much smaller than Florida or California or Paris. MUCH smaller with fewer rides.

However, we went to Hong Kong Disneyland in the second day. Fortunately, the weather of the second day was better. When we arrived there, we saw amazing thing which was a few of people in Hong Kong Disneyland. We argued that it was because of the weather. In this case, we played games faster. However, compare to Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller, the equipment of Hong Kong Disneyland also is fewer, and the consumption between Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland is the same. Although Hong Kong Disneyland is not as good as Tokyo Disneyland, there is also attracting me to go. It is because it is near to Macau, and has the same language. Recently, I saw the news that is about extending Hong Kong Disneyland. Therefore, I will go there one more time."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are cute and funny. I buy some souvenir even though they are very expensive. Haha!!!One of the most amazing magic in the Disney park is a  talking trash can  in the world of tomorrow. It is cute!!I felt very romantic at night, because it will have a firework display, many people will see it before they left. It is very beautiful.It is a good place suitable for every age!

The rides are excellent. Expect to fall in line though, because this is a favorite tourist destination especially for families traveling with kids. The food available around Disneyland could be a bit pricey as well, especially in the restaurants. But the meals are decent and there's a lot to choose from. I think a meal with rice is around 200 HKD. Do not leave before the parade and fireworks though. It won't be a full experience if you miss it. The shows are great too! This place is perfect for relaxation but could be very crowded on weekends."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reserved a Minnie Mouse cake at Plaza Inn for my daughter's 7th birthday and they even gave her gifts! Disney staff gave stickers! Advisable to get 2 day park ticket.

I would save and go the the US instead....,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Staff were really friendly and mascots were all around so people did not have to run to different locations just to take a selfie with the mascot. The rides were perfect but the waiting time was a little too long. The shops were packed with so many souveneirs and plush toys.

"438327843,4,2016-11,Sri Lanka,""I was traveling to HK on business and went to the park as a solo traveler. This is my first experience to a Disney park but I've been to Universal, Ferrari world, dream world etc. in comparison I thought this is more suitable for kids. Very few selective rides for adults. When you check the park map you see they have elaborated even little things like walk through snow whites castle, wishing well, fairy garden etc but actually there's nothing much to experience. I went there around 10 am and since I had e ticket my entry was easy. You have machines to get the ticket. By 3pm I had finished all different sections of the park and finished rides for adults. Hyperspace ride in tomorrow land and big grizzly mountain ride will give you adrenaline rush. Then there are some magical musical show with Mickey and few other like toy story parachutes fall. There's a ferry ride and visit to Tarzan's tree house which was so boring. I took adventure park boat ride and it is also recommended for kids. There's a train ride around the park which is good for you to get an idea of all attractions and how crowded they are. I couldn't do lion king concert since I had a flight to catch. At 3pm the parade started. It was short and only about 6 carriages and was over within 30 mins. I left after this but heard there are light shows in the night but I couldn't wait since I had a flight. But overall I thought you don't need full day for this park unless you have kids. You can either come at 10 and leave by 4 or come around 12 and stay back for night shows. It never extremely crowded. Queues were bearable. I went on a weekday so probably weekend could be different. I think this is good as a Disney theme park but it's very small so plan your day accordingly. Recommended for kids but not much for adults "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"438193467,5,2016-11,India,""We had a magical holiday at the hongkong disneyland. We stayed at the disney hollywood hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is plush with all modern amenities. Very nice ambience. This hotel does not have room service. Hence all meals have to be taken at the hotel's resturants. There are 3 of them. Chef Mickey (buffet resturant) is the best and serves limited indian dishes. It is also very expensive. One meal for 2 adults and one child can cost around 950 hkd. For those who savour non vegetarian food, chef mickey is a delight....the non veg spread is quite elaborate. The breafast at chef mickey is more economical. The indian vegetarian options are limited at breakfast as well. Infact it is the same daal makhani, steam rice, laccha paratha combination that you can expect during breakfast, lunch as well as dinner at chef mickey. We had one breakfast and one dinner at chef mickey. We tried out 2 dinners and one lunch at studio lounge ( ala carte resturant) at hollywood hotel. It offered the same indian vegetarian dishes as chef mickey but at half the cost (for 2 adults and 1 child). Each meal cost us around 500hkd at studio lounge. One thing we must mention, the daal makhani preparation at the hotel is simply amazing. It tastes like it has been prepared by any of the good restaurants in india.We had breakfast at enchanted garden (located at hotel disney land which is about 1 km away from hollywood hotel) for 2 days. Enchanted garden has charecter dinning with goofy pluto and mickey of course (as against chef mickey which only had mickey). Breakfast at Enchanted garden is slightly expensive than chef mickey. The breakfast spread at both enchanted garden and chef mickey is good (indian vegetarian). Daal makhani was there ( at both breakfast venues)!!The hotel does not have a shuttle that goes from hollywood hotel to disneyland hotel (the shuttles go from disneyland hotel to hollywood hotel to disney park to disneyland hotel) abd hence we had to walk around 1 km on both the days. The walk was pleasant though but with a small child becomes very slow. Hence please keep 20 mins grace if you are walking from hollywood hotel to enchanted garden. Meeting disney charecters at enchanted gardens is an awesome experience. We enjoyed it a lot. All the 3 charecters were very good and posed for photographs. The staff at enchanted gardens was very helpful.The disney park was an amazing experience as well. We had taken 2 day tickets. Covered all the rides we liked. Our daughter (3.5 years old) enjoyed winnie the pooh, phillar magic, dumbo the elephant, parachute drop, lion king, river safari and skinky dog. Grizzly gulch is a thrilling ride and we will not recommend it for children below 5 years. It has lots of jerks twists and turns at high speed. But a very thrilling ride for adults.Loved the experience at disneyland hk"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
438185231,5,2016-11,United Kingdom,I visited with my wife after my son said to see the lion king show. We arrived just after 10am and after a bag check purchased tickets and went straight in . The park was everything you needed. Very clean lots of food choices and restrooms. My son was right the lion king show was awesome . As was the Mickeys story book. We stayed until the Christmas light turn on at 630pm .It was fantastic. We didn't stay for the fireworks because I was worn out . On leaving the park we noticed lots of people were just turning up. Probably for the fireworks. Hong Kong Disney is much smaller than Orlando but it was more enjoyable. All the staff in HK were excellent while the staff in Orlando seemed bored and rude. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's good that we had this mindset because apart from the size of the park, there wasn't much Disney atmosphere. The exception was the parade which was one of the highlight. It shows that if they tried, they could capture the much needed Disney atmosphere. Anyhow, our granddaughter had a good time and that's good enough for us."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The RC Racer was closed and the Autopia was gone, I assume to make room for the new Stark Ironman ride. Gates don't open until 10:30am and it closes at 7:30pm so it made it difficult to have dinner and continue on the rides."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I highly recommend you to visit this place because every corner of the place is picturesque. The only downside is that the place is very large and it gets a little tiring to walk around but it is worth it. I also advise you to bring a small bag so that it won't be hard for you to walk around.

"437735552,4,2015-12,Macau,""Hong Kong Disneyland was my childhood which I really want to go. When I was young, the most exciting was hearing my family that wanted to take to visit and play Hong Kong Disneyland. In Hong Kong Disneyland, you can find that it was actually princess life. It was because that there are play an ancient house, roads and even had a castle. Additional, it also had the roller coaster, it was so exciting. However, Before, whether went to Hong Kong Disneyland that was determined by my family choice. But now, that was my choice. I would like to date my friends and nephew and niece to play. It was because that in my view, no matter adult or child, they still had right to play. According this view, in December 2015, I date my family to go Disney, the weather was great, sunshine when we started to play. However, it suddenly raining and brainstorm.

We did that, and then upgraded to an annual pass and visited 4 times in one trip! Outside food,e.g. hot food, sandwiches, is not allowed. Snacks and water are OK. Bags are checked upon entry.

I was most impressed by the  flying over the Space Mountain , we took the spacecraft to travel space. I opened my eyes widely to see the stars and meteors when the spacecraft flys slowly at first. While the spacecraft to speed up and suddenly, a sharp turn, my mother and I were frightened, with head buried low.Disneyland is worthy of a world brand of paradise, her magic beauty is unparalleled. Using the paradise to describe it is more appropriate When night fell, people also refused to leave, because there is a fireworks show.

437636766,5,2016-11,Australia,If you are going to HK then Disneyland is a must see. Even if you dont have kids. They have enough shows to keep everyone interested. The parades are amazing and so is the fireworks. The photos with the characters are sure to cheer up kids and also adults. The lion king show and the 3d movie is quite well done and entertaining. You would need more than one day to enjoy the park. If you can then book at one of the hotels in disneyland for a night and make use of their 2 day pass. would feel a bit expensive but is absolutely worth it. Considering the parks in AU you get half the entertainment for double the price.Our whole family enjoyed our time at Disneyland and came back with lots of happy shops and souvenirs. absolutely amazing. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"437636509,5,2015-12,Singapore,""We spent the whole day there and had no problem finding Halal food as there are few Halal restaurants within the Disneyland itself.We enjoyed the rides. There are many rides suitable for my toddlers for example the train ride that circulates the whole Disneyland.The parade was at about 4pm and we even had a chance take very good pictures as we were seated very near to the performers.The best part was the Fireworks display at 8pm sharp. It was about 45 min long and it was so beautiful and emotional and I was really moved by the songs that was played during the display.After the fireworks, there was snow falling down and it felt so real! My 2 toddlers played in the snow and had a blast!We had a great time!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"437255313,4,2016-10,Canada,""This is my second time to Hong Kong Disneyland, although my visits have been about 10 years apart. My feeling about the park remains the same.You have to feel a bit bad for HKDL. It was, basically, built on the cheap with the expectation that people would come no matter what. And they didn't. Significant investment has been made but the fact remains that this is the only park around the world that doesn't have much going for it.While the place has changed much for the better since I went just after it opened, it's still a pretty small place. One day is more than enough time to explore this park   in fact, you may find yourself bored by the end of the day. The day we visited was incredibly quiet and we did almost everything in the park in about 6 hours. They have some new unique rides that are fun, but sadly most of the parks original rides are clones from other parks around the world making it the most bland Disney park on earth.Nevertheless, I still give it 4 stars. Cast members are happy and friendly, the place still has the Disney touch and it operates well as a whole. It's just never going to be Orlando, or Tokyo or even Shangai   it's brand new competitor due north. At the end of the day, however, Hong Kong Disneyland still offers some magic to everyone."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"437238892,4,2016-6,United States,""My fiancee and I visited Disneyland Hong Kong in June of 2016 and though it rained half of the day we had a great time. If you have been to Disneyland or Disneyworld in America your first reaction might be disappointment as the park is considerably smaller but if you remember to enjoy it for what it is you will have a great time. It is possible to see the whole park in one day and most of the major attractions are just like you will find in America (keep in mind that the whole city of Hong Kong takes up less room on a map than the Disneyworld park does). The lines were very short on all of the attractions the day that we were there and the train made it very convenient to get to and from the park. Of course we spent a small fortune in the gift shops. All in all I would say it was a very pleasant experience, just keep your expectations in line."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"436849627,4,2016-11,Indonesia,""This is not my first time to Disneyland. I've been to the other older Disney when I was a kid. Now that I have my own kid, this Disney was the nearest to my hometown so I bring my toddler here. November is a good month to travel in HK, it was cool but sunny so it was really nice. Go during weekdays in low season like I did n there's less time you need to queu n more time to play. My toddler had a blast, everything was run professionally, the parade was okay. My toddler got picked up to dance with the fairies n she was so delighted. I prepared a Rapunzel costume for her to wear n she was beaming n feeling more princesslike during our time here. Why only 3 stars? During low season n weekdays so many of the restaurants n cafes are closed. So We are curbing our hunger with food fron the stalls such as hotdog, chicken leg, korean bbq squid n snacks like popcorn or mickey waffle. Not exactly the healthiest option but hey.. It is a vacation"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Long queues with no premium passes to bypass them was a bummer.. also there were literally no live characters that the kids got a chance to see..they were soo disappointed!!! The parade was the saving grace.. what a visual treat it was, and we were glad we stayed back. Another plus and a hidden gem was the vegetarian Indian thali we chanced upon, as we were told theres very few veg option.. super happy to get decent Indian food.It needs better attractions, as most r ides felt repetitive in each zone."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
436838622,5,2016-10,India,Once you enter Disneyland each step is magical! You don't know where to look and where to go. You want to do everything. Best time to reach is by 10am as there are shorter queues for all rides and one can actually do more rides if you reach early. By noon its crowded and that means longer queue. If you are a fan I would think you will go mad :) but stay sane. There is food for everyone. The restaurants serve food from the globe even tandoori chicken . If you have a baby or small kid you can go to the office and hire a stroller. Kids will love it that way. It can be a bit hot so please take your shade and hats caps. If you have luggage and heading to airport post the visit you can store it at the office for 90hkd. Don't miss the Toy Story Land. Have fun!!!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
436798384,3,2016-11,United States,There was actually very little there  a few of the Disney classics but not too much else. It was an interesting visit but didn't require a lot of time. Several attractions were closed during my visit.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
436765177,4,2016-11,Australia,6 adults and 2 kids had a great time. A full days entertainment. There are a few adult rides but mostly caters for the younger. The street parade day and night are well worth seeing. The MTR delivered us from our motel in Kowloon direct to a Disney on Lantau Island . So well thought out ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"436750517,4,2016-11,Canada,""Easy to get to via metro, this was a highlight of our trip. We so wanted to visit on a not too hot day, so we can enjoy the whole day there without frying in the HK heatWe got our wish, and the day was perfect in every way. Don't get talked into transport, hotel pick up, blah, blah, blah. Their train system is superb, easy to navigate, and cheap. Hardly any waiting, you can move smoothly between any train transits, and before you know it you are there. From Kowloon district to Disneyland takes around 25 mins. There are regular trains back to where you need to go also. The resort is meticulously clean, with many rides on offer, to suit all ages. Plenty of seating and shade on offer, food to suit all budgets, with little pop ups here and there where you can purchase souvenirs, drinks, popcorn, etc. Please note you will be searched as you enter the venue. And no food is allowed to be taken in. Water is allowed. The venue was quite small, around the same size as our (Oz) Movie World. I was expecting more of an interactive experience, however we both really enjoyed the whole day. It was their special Halloween night. We did not stay cos the crowds were swelling hugely! In summary affordable, plenty of souvenirs to fill your packs, great food and service, colourful, and some really good rides, and a whole lot cheaper than flying to the real deal in US. I guess it is a good thing that we have not visited any of the other Disneyland venues. Nothing to compare it too. For a family I feel it is quite affordable, in these economic times. And using the public transport system will save you even more, while providing you with another view of everyday life for the locals. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"436670319,5,2016-11,Australia,""Visited on a Tuesday and the park was very quiet. We got onto everything we wanted within 20 minutes, amazing. Have been to lots of other Disneys and this one ranks as my favourite"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"436586576,4,2016-11,United States,""So I'll preface my review by saying I grew up while WDW was being built and have been more times than I can remember. Likewise I've had the opportunity to go to Disneyland California 8 10 times over the years. And a few years back visited Disneyland Paris.... so you might say I'm a semi Disney park fan ";" ). This visit actually was a half day out of a 3 day weekend in Hong Kong, to make it 4 of 5 of the parks I've been to. So the above isn't to brag or anything, but to help you understand my perspective on The HK version. Getting to the park via special Disney MTR train was cool. Not overdone, but a nice tough. The MTR station in HK Disney was also themed to get you into the mood. Walkway and engrave area slowly pulled you in. I went in November and the crowds were very manageable, imagine in summer it's horrific though, although they seem well sized for big crowds. General layout was very similar to the spoke and wheel of the other Disney parks Magic Kingdoms, but looping from Adventure land around to Fantasyland was where it was most different. It was also where it was the most fun. My favorite ride was their version of Thunder Mountian Railroad (Big Grizzly), with a couple of, we'll call them,  twists . It was awesome, road it twice. The other was lost akin to Haunted Mansion (Mystic Manor) which is actually better to me (ride it twice too). Missing was Pirates of the Caribbean, which I think is unique for this park. There is no New Orleans. Other missing items had just different themed ones instead. Overall the park felt smaller the either D Cal or D Paris, but may not be. I was able to do all the rides I cared to (skipped all the ones in Fantasy Land except one and it took me 4 hours. For sure with bigger crowds it would take longer, but it gives a sense of the size. The Castle in particular was quite small, once you walk through it felt like 4 steps and you were out he other side. Wasn't very tall either, a bit of a disappointment. Food was interesting for a guy from the States. While there were burgers and such to be found, most restaurants served a heavily Asian based fare, go figure... in Hong Kong In the end I was glad I went, but given the opportunity again, I'm not sure I would. It was neat once but too few great rides like it seems the other parks have. I'm not digging on D HK, it is based on my previous experiences as I mentioned previously. If you haven't been I absolutely suggest you go, you'll have a great, no Magical, time. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

"436472276,5,2016-11,Canada,""What can I say I loved my visit, it's great, just as magical as other Disney parks, although it's more cutesy then grand and over the top! I went on a week day, the crowds so small, I wait no more then ten min to get onto any ride. At first you may think there is not a lot to do,but it's definitely a full day, I was too relaxed thinking I'd have more time then attractions, but once I made a plan around the shows and parades, I was left scrambling and squeezing every second I had to finish the rides and eat! lol I have been to every Disney property, except the new one in China, I love the uniqueness of HK Disney, but I must confess I'm left wondering what's with the scale of the castle? It's a bit of a let down, it's very odd, still very pretty but it should be a highlight, it's almost lost, I wonder about how that design came to be! Thank You For a great experience!!

436469478,3,2016-10,Australia,This would be a great disney experience for families with small children as there are lots of character photo ops and park is fairly compact.After visiting Disneyworld and Disneyland this was a bit of a let down.

"436338298,5,2016-10,United States,""THE reason we visited Hong Kong and we were so glad to do so. Compared to the Flordia, California and even Tokyo DL this one is smaller but nevertheless the fun was unlimited. The property was very well maintained, directions were as usual pretty good. One weird thing was some shows were in Chinese which we found funny (no pun intended) as we were alien to the language and more than that the lines were coming out from Mickey and company. The Halloween parade was awesome and so were the Halloween themed fireworks (we went in October). We had a great time and will not loose an opportunity of visiting again.

Personal advice  don't buy anything from here... its too costly.. same stuff available at airport and other places in the city and a much discounted rate...

Sure, the shows are good (Lion King is still one of the best show) but there is just nothing special that makes you want to stay anytime longer.

"434998519,5,2016-11,Philippines,""First, the transportation to HK Disneyland was very good. Our trip was on a Thursday which might be why it was not that crowded as we were dreading it to be. It was a sizeable crowd still but the lines   queues were manageable. The attraction was great. The parade and the fireworks was just funtastic! The only theme park we were not able to visit was the Mystic Point but our 4year old had a blast with Princess Elsa and Anna. Also had her picture with Buzz Light Year. The shows were also very entertaining like the Lion King and Mickey Mouse (  Donald Duck's) magical show. Our daughter loved the Donald Duck's show very much.The food was on a high side but we thought it was reasonable compared to the other HK attracion (OP). The serving was nice at the Star Liner. Three meals would have been enough for us 4 Filipinos of 3 adult and 4 yo.I was worried about the transportation after the fireworks given the big crowd but the MTR was very efficient. Wow. I have been making reviews and  MTR was very efficient  was always in it. It was just great.We will be returning to HK Disneyland for sure.

Older kids might find it boring however it's just the right size for the smaller ones before they get too tired. Staff give out huge amounts of stickers to the kids too!

"434742027,4,2016-10,Canada,""This was my first time going to HK Disneyland and my first time going to any Disney park as an adult, but it made no difference because it was Disney!We came on a Tuesday, the day after a long weekend, and it was wonderful. Busy enough that we didn't want to line up to take photos with the characters, but quiet enough that we only needed to line up at most for 5 minutes for a ride. Some rides we went on more than once just because we could and the lack of line ups made it worth the time.The prices in the shops were what you expected   expensive. The food was surprisingly good. Expensive as any food would be in a theme park, but it wasn't bland like I expected. My husband who went nearly ten years ago (as a young adult, ha) was not as impressed. He enjoyed it very much still, but did comment on how the staff did not look as happy and energetic (by Disney standards) and that it looked a bit rundown, compared to before and what you would expect from the Disney business. For examples, paint was chipping off on a few of the rides and the mannequins in the shops were not in good condition (one had all but his middle finger broken off). For the price you pay, you would expect more in its maintenance. We went on must of the rides and spent a good amount of time in the shops, and were walking out just after 4 hours. We may consider coming back when we have kids, but would be willing to splurge a little more for another Disney location if the upkeep is better there."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The station is also different from other mtr station.You can buy ticket online and sometimes there's some promotion buying online.

Don't forget bring the confirmation and credit card you use to buy online. Behind the ticket booth there's some ticket machine to get the tickets and food vouchers.Tips :  go there on weekdays  check the weather on the chosen day  take the map of the park (located near the toilet after the entrance gate)  there are several drinking water tap in the park, don't forget to bring the bottle  fast pass is available in some games (information in the map), take the one that interest you, so you can save time  restaurant are spread in all over the park and food & drink stall too  parade and firework are show in the evening so finish playing before the parade  souvenir shop also spread all over the park and the biggest one is in the main road before the entrance (from inside)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I went to City Hall Guest service and they let me call from Hong Kong back to Finland for free! Thank you so much for that! It was so helpful and kind, cause I was travelling solo and couldn't contact Finnair online, which was really annoying. There were no lines on that day which was really great, but a bit sad was that not all the restaurant were open and they even opened land one by one. So after park opened you still needed to wait until they open all lands.I loved the shows especially Mickey and the Wondrous Book and I loved it that they actually sang by themselves! And the Festival of Lion King too.Halloween parades were quiet short if you compare to other parades, which was a little minus and also even if staff at Guest Service were really helpful and didn't find customer service overall at the Park as good as at Shanghai Disneyland.

On the positive side of things, however, the lines tend to be blissfully short, so if you can only spare four or five hours, the park is still worth visiting.

The park is on a much smaller scale to any of the others but that made it so easy to get around in such a short space of time, we arrived around 1030 and were finished by 2pm but waited until 3 for the Halloween parade. The rides which I have been on before in the other parks were slightly different which was really good as you don't know whats coming. The day we went queues were not long at all on average 15 min waits. It was the Halloween festival while we were there so lots of things going on, there were people dressed up giving out free candy.The parade was a Halloween themed one which was really good.

The Corner Cafe on Main Street was where we had lunch and quite frankly it is some of the worst service and the worst food I have ever seen in my life.

We arrive in early morning and the queues were very short as a result. Staff were friendly and keen to know how we were enjoying our visit. The queues to have pictures taken with characters were probably the longest but staff were great at making sure people were being fair with photos and the characters themselves were brilliant. Our favourite rides were probably the run away mine cars and the Star Wars ride. Toy Story Land was the best for photo opportunities. My one recommendation for people visiting would to be to bring your own food and drink as it is expensive here. You'll need the money you save to spend on souvenirs!,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Luckily we rode all the rides before 2 pm. At 2 pm, mobs and mobs of people came streaming in. Not sure if there was a special event? But from that point on, lines were 40 min or longer. Also, it was fun collecting stickers from the Disney employees. (That's something they don't do at Anaheim.) It is smaller than Anaheim, but being able to NOT wait in line before 2 pm made the whole experience worth it. And it was so easy to get there via MTR. Also, we were able to get on the first MTR train we walked up to after exiting the park, after the fireworks. They must be very efficient. WIth so many people exiting, I was expecting a long wait for a train. Also bring mosquito repellent. I was bitten a lot within 15 min. of entering the park, and I noticed I wasn't the only one.

We went on hyperspace mountain about 5 times. Towards the end of the day was best for short queues. Astroblasters was fun and Mystic manor was awesome for special effects. We hardly had time to eat, wasn't cheap. If you are not too fussed about getting close to sleeping beauty castle for the fireworks, I would stand at the top of the train station.

"431130779,3,2016-10,Philippines,""I have visited California Disney 2 times before in 2007 and 2010. This was our 3rd time to visit Disneyland but first time to go to Disney outside the USA. For the first time also I was taking my 6 year old daughter to a Disney park. She is a big fan of Elsa and Anna just like many girls :), and loves all Disney characters, knows their stories etc. Ok, Let me share some of my disappointments first   1. One thing we found missing was the courtesy in the staff at Disneyland HK towards visitors. There were less of helpers and more of process follower or policing staff in Disney land and this was something I have not observed in Disneyland resort earlier. Smiling and greeting attitude was missing in staff. It may be an ethnic or regional thing, as Chinese people seemed to be a bit rude in general (personal feeling, not to generalize).2. My daughter wanted to meet her favorite Disney characters but unfortunately she could not do. It was too much of time standing in the queues in the efforts to get a picture with them, but they do not even stop to allow taking a picture with them unlike in California. After standing in a queue for 2 hrs we could not meet Mickey and Minnie. I and my daughter just stepped out of Queue to get some food as she was hungry, but my wife was keeping our place in the queue, but when her turn came quicker than we thought and we got late to return just for 2 mins. we missed them once again :(. They could not wait on my wife's request as they said it was closing time for them (it was 6pm whereas park closes at 8pm). I immediately visited their guest services to request to allow just one picture with my daughter, but the reply I got was pretty cold  not possible sir .3. Overall the park is smaller in comparison with USA ones. but similarly ticket is also much lower than US"; so it was NOT a disappointment. Now the good things  1. Ticket Price is very competitive. With the usual cost of everything in Hongkong, this is pretty decent price to spend a day with your family with experience of Disneyland.2.

I will say for people seeking a thrill park (roller coasters, spooky rides etc) then you may be disappointed. It is a park which is highly suitable for kids and I couldn't think of one ride that a child wouldn't be able to partake in. The character meet and greets can be tricky if you don't plan accordingly   and they come out at the same times in different locations   which can mean choosing between some.

Disneyland does that & more .... in style.The evening fireworks was spectacularThe villains parade and Mickey Mouse parade funtastic.The rides were so cute that my younger one wanted to keep doing them. It was indeed magical for the kids and the glee on their faces was worth every minute  nickel spent. We took the 2 day pass, did the evening parade and fireworks on day 1 and spend the entire next day on the rides for children. None of the rides are scary. The slow ones are where the kids enjoy anyway....The boat ride was nice with a lot of animatronics which thrilled the kids. The shows were grand too.Final tip : Go during the weekday and if it's a kid centric holiday take the 2 day pass and expect to get a bit bored since adult rides are few and far. The happy kiddie faces will however replace the boredom you face.Must visit for children of all ages."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We saw the whole park, and with small kids, you can't do it all in one day... 2 days are enough, 3 too much... 1 not long enough .....We stayed at the Disney Hollywood hotel, which is on site (free shuttle ride to the park), extremely convenient and very overpriced for what you get... but with small kids, it was very convenient.The park is showing its age, and there is a new park in Shanghai now.... so.... worth having a look around, but if you are going to be HK, its definitely worth a visit for the little ones... probably 5  would get the most of it ....

We arrived about 1 hour before opening and had time to get our tickets (ordered online), take some pictures and see Mickey and Minnie  open  the park. The gates opened 30 minutes prior to park opening so you can visit Main St, but you have to wait to visit the other lands. Very small park. We walked around the whole thing in about 15 minutes. Rides very close together so you can get off one and right on to the next one. Went on a Friday and never waited more than 15 minutes for any ride. Since we were there early, we wanted to eat lunch early, but it seemed like most places did not open until 12:00 12:30. Some the snack places did not open up until after 1:30.

Although the queues were long they were generally less time than the signs indicated. The down side of the day, was the closing of half the park for a private function. Luckily there were plenty of signs and staff at the gate were helpful in suggesting to do that side of the park before it closed to the general public although we did miss a couple of rides. It was also hard to get a photo with some of the characters, always seemed to turn up just as the photo sessions were closing.On the plus side the fireworks show was amazing and well worth staying to see."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

But this Disney is smaller and the rides are less   scary and thrilling. It really is a wonderland for kids. My 12 year old niece enjoyed it but me, not as much. Also, when you watch the festival of lights, if ou can't go near from the center, better to be at the center even if you are far away. That way, you can still see the fireworks.

"428989422,4,2016-8,United States,""Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely different from the American amusement parks. It is smaller and can be done in a day, similar to Disney's California Adventures. The rides are different, with very few of the originals making it to this park. Those that did make it are changed up to fit a new crowd. The castle appears smaller than Sleeping Beauty's castle in Anaheim. Small World is definitely worth the ride no matter where you are. To see how each park sets up this iconic ride is interesting and almost makes you nostalgic for the one you call home.Be prepared for the Asian food. You are in another country and to expect them to provide the same foods you would get in America is not appropriate.The park is a lot of fun, even for being smaller. Definitely take some time to visit Toy Story Land. Worth the wait for the rides and I don't know how anyone could not want to visit this area for the rides."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
428969045,1,2016-10,Philippines,We entered Disneyland at 1pm. The sad thing is they closed all outdoor rides at 1:30 pm. Well they should have informed us before we bought the tickets. We went to Hongkong just to go to Disneyland. The tickets cost us more than 10k pesos (1617 HKD). They already know they're gonna close based on the forecast and yet they still let us buy the tickets. We only stayed inside for an hour or so. We just took pictures and rode the hyperspace mountain and took off. Bad experience. They only want the money... and didnt care if we lose it. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When we visited it was halloween time and themed so the parades seemed short with only 4 floats however thought this may be due to the Halloween theme? Therefore smaller parades as it isn't a permanent feature so not as much budget supplied? Still thoroughly enjoyed.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is a while since I've visited Disneyland Paris and Disney World Orlando and this feels much more designed for small children than the other parks. The park is also small and I think you can plan to do it in half a day. With small children maybe a bit longer.Some attractions are in Chinese only, so understanding what the characters are saying might be a problem.They close most of the attractions very early, already when the parade starts at 7PM, thus don't come too late to the park.Western food is not especially good, tried a hot dog and will never do that again. Very tasteless and strange consistency. There are a lot of Asian style options, maybe they taste better?

I LOVED IT! It is genuinely the happiest place on earth, you should definitely pre book your tickets, and with the MTR you can get there super cheap and easily. You don't need anything more than just your normal entry ticket really. We went on a Saturday, and it was totally fine, we didn't wait any more than 10 mins for a ride, average wait was 1 6 mins. We spent the entire day there (11am 8pm) and I could have used another couple of hours to fit everything in.Definitely recommend the Space Mountain and the runaway carts. They were the thrill seeker rides and I was surprised with Mystic Manor, definitely worth dropping in to.

"427758653,3,2015-11,Philippines,""To fully appreciate and enjoy disneyland, i suggest you to allocate an entire day for this place. Come as early as 9am and stay until the firework display finishes. Disneyland offers numerous attractions and rides where long queues are inevitable. So to save yourself from stress, it would be better to take your time and to take it easy. You will thank yourself for being patient at the end of the day. To be honest, the whole experience for me was a bit underwhelming because I couldn't help myself but compare my experience at Ocean Park the day before. I love animals and extreme rides that disneyland doesn't offer. Also, disneyland doesn't have views like where the seas meet the mountains that ocean park has. Meanwhile, there were things I enjoyed at disneyland that are unique from ocean park. In November 2015, disneyland's musical production was Lion King at that time. I loved every bit of it. I love musicals and all the songs of this musical. It was the closest experience I had to a Broadway production. On the other hand, there was a ride called Space Mountain that I thought was unforgettable. Me and my brothers even did it again twice as it was just so fun. It wasn't as big as the roller coaster at ocean park but it offered a different experience for us. It was a mini roller coaster inside a building that looked like a futuristic mountain from the outside. It felt like we were in the galaxy where it was dark but we could see bright lights like they were stars. As it was dark, every unexpected turn or curve was exhilirating and the galactic music synced with the coaster's speed just sealed the deal for me. It was my favorite ride at Disneyland. Even before coming to disneyland, I always knew that there would be a float parade. It was one of the much awaited attractions for me. We even left the queues just to witness the parade. It was like a celebration. The float parade brought out the kid in me. Most if not all classic disney characters were brought to life that left me smiling the whole time. Lastly, before we left disneyland, we also witnessed the fireworks display. It wasn't the best I've seen but the audio visual presentation in the foreground made all the difference.As a conclusion, if you love musicals, parades, and disney mascots, and you are fine with less intense but creative rides, then Disneyland might just be the perfect theme park for you!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"427559583,5,2016-9,Singapore,""We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland and the Disneyland Hotel about 20 times over the last 8 years. So one could say that we are somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to all Disney.. or at least Disney in Asia. We usually stay for at least 3   5 days on each of the occasions we have come. I would recommend this Disney park especially those with younger children or a combination of younger children to middle school aged kids. We have started to come here since my son's 2nd birthday and returned for each of his birthdays till to date as well as other occasions. We do like the guided tours, despite the cost, we feel it is money well spent, as you may have to wait more than an hour during peak times for rides. So unless the park is off season (like somewhere in the early or middle of March) on a cloudy Tuesday, you can expect a fair amount of wait on the rides. But its Disneyland, thus it should not come as a big shock to anyone...Over the years we have noticed that security has been beefed up.. although I have to say we have not had anything go missing and we felt very safe at all times, there were a couple of incidences that we have witnessed mainly fights between tour groups etc, that makes you glad that the security is a lot more visible. I would expect that if you are staying in the Kingdom Club and buying gifts for your children, dining on site and take a tour for at least 2 of the 4 days you may spend here that it would set you back close to 5,000   7,000 USD. Having said that you could easily do the same experience staying at the equally stylish Hollywood Hotel, with some onsite dining options and spend less than 1,500 USD in Off season...with tickets included. It will not make any difference to your children, if you are price conscious go with your wallet.. but still go cause the kids will love it.My kiddo does not recall any of his trips before his 5th Birthday so you can get away with anything.. infact they will be just as happy walking around the park at the age of 2 3 and not even going on any rides. Of course you may want to murder them because you just paid for your own ticket ... but the expression you will see on your child's face is literally priceless when they spot Mickey or Minney. For very small children I would recommend staying in the Hollywood hotel, and going over to the Enchanted Garden for a meal (character dining) with a birthday cake, mostly (not always) if you request and the hotel is not too busy they will try to accommodate either Mickey or Minnie wishing your child a Happy Birthday.. indeed for a while my son only allowed Mickey to wish him Happy Birthday and only with a blue balloon... yet the staff went out of their way to ensure that my son has the delightful Disney experience and made sure that they had Mickey and the blue balloon. I would recommend you try to go for an early seating at the Enchanted Garden and actually get there right on opening.. 5:30 pm, this will allow the staff to accommodate more of your preferences. It will be impossible if you trying to do the same in the second seating 8:00 pm onward.. the restaurant is just too busy.. If you have a little girl I would recommend staying at the Disney Hotel for the princess effect.The Boutique, the Princess in the Hotel Lobby.. its totally worth it. Leading me to the Kingdom Club, why would you pay an additional arm and a leg when you have already forked out tickets, gifts, etc.. because its awesome ... seeing your child being wished Good Night by Mickey or Minnie (they change each night.. so if you want to catch both you may need to stay 3 nights..) is beyond magic. The pure love, the expression of total happiness is something money can't buy, (that's why you have a MasterCard) so if you have to pull an extra shift at work to make this happen.... I suggest you try.. (but wait until they are like 5 at least cause they won't remember) you will have pictures .. but nothing much else from their memory bank.At 6 or 7 when they trail off to MineCraft.. you have them lost, I see a ton of kids playing with their phone, electronic devices, whilst queuing totally bored to death.. its just a bit too late to start bringing them to Disneyland. Unless of course you are going to Tokyo Disneyland.. which is mostly for older kids 100%.. We can't wait for the ToyStory Hotel to open or the new Iron Man ride, and yes even though we do not live in Hong Kong we have an annual pass, the savings are great.. hotel and merchandise discounts.. and if you are going more than once a year, it is worth it.. So save up and go and have a MAGICAL DAY!!! Don't yell at your kids, don't make them go on the rides they don't want.. Don't make them pose ...and just be.. enjoy that you have kids, enjoy the Disney Magic.. and just BE... :) "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although we had time to stay longer the kids were starting to get tired, and by then they have gone on most of the rides. Excellent place to spend the day. We went mid week so had no queuing for any of the rides. Staff friendly and lots of entertainment happening throughout the day. Bring lots of extra cash for souvenirs! Food is expensive so take cash or take your own snacks especially drinks. The humidity of Hong Kong makes you thirsty!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

427350133,4,2016-10,United Kingdom,Nice day out even if haven't got kids. Reasonably priced event. Easy get to via the MTR. Take in the Star Wars live shows great for getting kids involved. All the Disney attractions and characters you would expect to see. But one of my favourite parts of this site is the 3D cinema. Where you are not only watching 3D which lets face it is everywhere now. But you also get the wind the rain and the smells from the show.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
427263339,4,2016-9,South Africa,I visited la the Disneyland all over the world and its always a nice outing. The parade was really nice but the park and its rides was more catered for smaller children.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"427242586,4,2016-9,India,""We went there for 2 days. Once on a Sunday and once on a tuesday. The experience was totally different both days. Here are some does and donts     Go on a Weekday and have a splendid time. No waiting or maximum 10 minutes waiting for best rides.. Go on a Sunday and the only thing you will see are people people and hoards of people. Trust me i am from india ( quite used to crowds ) , but still i was dumbstruck by the crowds. You will be able to do a maximum of 3 rides in a 5 hrs time if on sunday. And forget getting a seat in any restaurant if you're tired. But weekdays the same place is inviting and empty , you will love it.   The USP of this disney is the  Lion King Show   , its the best of the lot. Next is the Mickey Wonderous Book Show. There is ample space in the Audi's showing these shows ( even on sundays ). So just reach the venue maximum 10 to 15 min before start of show.   Best Rides   Mystic Manor , Grizzly Gulch Roler Coaster , RC racer ( didnt do nightmare experiment and command post as had small child ). Both Parades and Fireworks are good. Other rides like Carousel , Its a Small World , Pooh , Stinky dog , Parachute drop , mickey philar etc are good for little kids  Avoidable rides   Hyperspace mountain ( can avoid if u have done Transformers in Universal Studios , its not even 20% of that ) , Buzz Astroblazers ( very kiddish )   Explorers Club , Starliner Diner and Main Street Cafe are Aircon'd ( trust me u will need them ) so a better choice. Dont buy water , there is taps to fill drinking water outside every washroom. Watermelon Juice is 30hk and average meal for 2 1 at the above mentioned restr will be approx 350hk. Indian food at explorers club and tahiti terrace ( it was closed when we went ) .   MTR is convenient , even after fireworks in sunday , when an enormous crowd dispersed for return back , it wasnt much of a hassle and a train every 4 minutes cleared the crowd in no time. Get an On Loan octopus from airport as we did on arrival.   On weekdays it is possible to do the park in one day , but would advise for 2days if with kids as they get tired.   Shop at last from Mainstreet ( u get everything there ) , some shops at mystic manor are also good...   We met quite a few characters on tuesday but on sunday ( wooh... dont even expect to find any as there will be stampede ) In summary its a magical place to visit , spend two days there. Go on a weekday , one day enter at 11am, next day you can go late around 3pm and stay late for fireworks. Have fun  "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our favorite ride was the majestic mansion. and the grizzly bear was a thrill! my daughter and i dont usually ride stuff life that. but we tried it cause we could see even smaller kids going on. my daughter got a bit scared cause it was going really fast and it went backward! which was unexpected cause we didnt know that part! haha. all in all we had a good time! ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Probably more suited to very young children and not so much for the older kids or teens. On a day that is not too busy, you can get through the park quite quickly so still needs more. Felt there were more shops and eating places than rides but then it does take time to build up attractions in these parks. Still worth it if you have kids that haven't been to the original in LA."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"425950697,4,2016-10,Japan,""Great experience for first timers. Must try rides include Grizzly Gulch and The Nightmare Experiments. Very good actors in The Nightmare Experiments. Different creepy sensation due to its human actors. However the actors need to be very careful for the personal space. What good about machine is that it is already designed for the human safety but if the machine is replaced by human actors, creativity can be happening during the show and for sure it must not violate the safety rules. For me, I don't prefer human actors especially in the horror rides."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

425282027,2,2016-10,Australia,The price to get in here was pretty steep for what you get for it. The Gulch mine cart ride was well worth it and the boat trip around the island at adventure land (I think) was entertaining. The Star Wars ride was thrilling through pitch darkness but the wait for this ride was ridiculous and no fans or coolers to keep such a large number of people cool in high heat and humidity while they wait. We just waited for long periods of time in line after line for short rides. There weren't too many spots to sit down to rest and you could only buy the designated branded items on sale at their high prices for food and drinks.

One of the best was a Halloween special called Mickey's Laboratory which was excellent but very scary! There are a couple of roller coasters and a 3d cinema, plus the simpler rides like winnie the pooh.Food seemed reasonably priced and varied. It's a small park, much smaller than Paris and Orlando.

Importantly on my own I felt safe within the park.Both parades were great as was the fireworks at the end of the night.Two minor drawbacks   there was little seating throughout the park outside resturants to sit down to break and food drink was a little overpriced with few options (but you do expect this in a park like this).My favourite part was so hard to decide but I loved all the areas!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Others are saying food in the park was expensive but I don't think so. We went to Royal Banquet Hall and the prices were Ok. You can even save a little bit if you buy meal vouchers online in advance. One thing I experienced during my visit in September was that they made a Halloween Mickey head near the entrance, which I did not enjoy very much, just in my personal opinion."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"423464753,4,2016-9,Australia,""Visited 27 28th September and generally had a great time. Park was busy but not like America but was very hot so this made queuing quite tiring. As at most Disney parks the prices were excessive for little quality (in terms of food) and meeting princesses and other characters was badly managed. As a father of 2 children I was extremely frustrated at the time spent queuing, not because I begrudged it but because 80% of people in the queue were adults who wanted 5  photos and autographs. Maybe it's just me but I thought that sort of thing was for children? Other than that I have been to Orlando and Paris and feel this park more than holds its own. Our only disappointment was the princesses were not involved in the parades as its Halloween, I feel they could have been involved in the 15:00 parade. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"423248287,5,2016-9,United States,""Loved this small Disneyland park. From someone who is a frequent visitor to WDW in Florida (which is HUGE), this small park was a welcome change. The weather was ridiculously hot but we enjoyed touring this park for two days. Could have been done in one day but it was nice to stay at the hotel when the heat was the worst. This is a beautifully landscaped, clean park. The ride lines were short when we were there and we enjoyed riding a couple rides (such as Mystic Manor) that are unique to HK Disneyland. Hong Kong on the whole is a beautiful place, the people are friendly and it is very much  western  friendly with most people speaking English. My only complaint is there could be more quick service restaurants with more  western  food. Trying to find food other than snacks in the park was very challenging. I would love to return to HK to spend more time and in doing so would return to HK Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

All in all it was a very memorable experience, and our LITTLE KID INSIDE did come out and Enjoyed singing  A Whole New World  while watching the Fireworks. The only thing that was disappointing is that there are no Disney characters present that time.Just an addition, the transportation was very good in Hong Kong, it is very easy to go anywhere, anytime.

"422692257,5,2016-9,Malaysia,""I read that this is the smallest Disneyland so when we visited last week we really take our time enjoying everything. We went with children age 3 and 5. We've been to Disneyland Tokyo and LA. I think i like Hong Kong the most because it's small so we don't have to walk far from one attraction to the next. So we started our tour on Adventure Land and walk towards the Fantasy Land. We spend quote sometimes in Toy Story and Fantasy Land because there are many things for younger kids. By 7pm we didn't have time to walk through Tomorrow Land. The tips is to be excited and just enjoy everything, if you are a Disney Lover. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
422521460,4,2016-9,Canada,If you have option better visit other disneylands... this one is very small and in Sept when we went was very hot and humid.  Typical disneyland fun.. kids will enjoy... parade is fun  Everything inside is very expensive.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"422279530,5,2015-10,India,""Everything is spic and span in this place, enticing you and promising great entertainment, but for the queues and long waiting time. The Toy Story Land parachute drop, dog spin and RC racer are designed to draw your adrenalin in gushes, but naturally the queues are longer here. I liked the Adventureland attractions the most, Rafts to Tarzan   s Tree House, Jungle River Cruise being my best features. The waiting time was less here. This segment held out a great promise.The Space Mountain high speed ride in dark at the futuristic Tomorrowland segment is full of thrills. Never miss it. The parade show is full of fun and frolic and, of course, the expected dose of glitter. The fireworks show with the castle background in the evening was for me a show of a life time. It was so well coordinated with the accompaniment of music.All these and the journey in the special Disneyland train makes it a sparkling place for wholesome entertainment."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"422249513,4,2016-9,Singapore,""We visited HK disneyland on a Monday and entered around 11am. With our experience at Tokyo Disneyland, we very already planned out our route and deciding which fast pass we should get. To our pleasant surprise there is no need for fast pass at all. My first few rides had waiting times of 5 15min and the longest I waited was for a performance which is 45min and that is still so much shorter as compared to the 2 3hrs wait for one ride at Tokyo. The night parade was sadly suspended during our trip but the fireworks was still awesome. The atmosphere is definitely lacking as compared to Tokyo Disneyland but in return u get shorter queues and more rides. Not too bad actually ";") "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

422167938,4,2016-8,Cte d'Ivoire,Hong Kong is so modern and so high that i was expecting something bigger...but it is actually a smaller DisneyLand Park than the one in Paris for exemple. the good thing is the wait was a third of the wait you will do in paris in the same month,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

422034258,3,2016-9,Australia,Very clean and no long lines for rides. A little sterile and very few characters so not a lot of life very good for small children but not teenaged looking for a thrill  even a little boring. Worth a trip to say you've been but not like it's sister version in LA ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
421980365,4,2016-9,India,Disneyland...One of the most important reason for my Hong Kong visit was good. The park is planned quite well and has ample activities for the kids. The Storytelling was also excellent. The only thing it lacked was high adrenaline rides such as roller coasters which can give you goosebumps as we have experienced in other theme parks.The Halloween parade was very well organised. The fireworks was awesome and have never seen such a live co ordinated show of this sort.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
421971865,3,2015-10,United Arab Emirates,We would not recommend to spend time at the Disney in Hong Kong if you have visited the disneyland in Paris and the US.The Visitors are rude and don`t follow the line concept. we were surprised that some of they just keep pushing to jump the line.Horrible experience. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"421846641,4,2016-8,United Kingdom,""We booked our tickets for Disneyland Hong Kong in the U.K. before we flew out to Asia.Park was easy to get to, we used the Hong Kong railway system and it was easy and efficient. The last train ride is a Disney themed train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and handrail etc. My 3 year old daughter loved that.Ticket system was quick and we didn't have to wait long to enter the park. Hong Kong Disney reminded me a lot of Disneyland Paris, but I did prefer Paris. The palace at the bottom of Main St is a lot smaller than that in Paris, but the usual merchandise stores are there in HK.My daughter particularly loved the Fantasyland area as it is all Princess themed. Queues weren't too bad considering the time of year we visited.There's a really lovely Tarzan Treehouse which we all loved. As well as Grizzly Gulch with squirting fountains. These were a great relief from the boiling heat we had when we visited.We went to see the the early afternoon parade and got into our places fairly early, although, unlike Paris it would seem this early position is not necessary. Parade was lovely with most of the main characters making an appearance.We ate in one of the Disneyland Hotels and went for the character dining options. It was all you can eat buffet style, which again we booked before we left the UK. The buffet was delicious with loads of options and we met Mickey, Minnie, Tigger & Piglet. Be warned though, very very expensive! (  170 for the three of us!!!!!!) A lovely day was had by all of us, it sure I'd hurry back but glad we have been. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
421759843,5,2016-9,India,I had visited for my sons 10th birthday but it left me mesmerised It takes you to a different world The shows are awesome The day and night parade is a must watch The characters lovely My son was Jedi fighting with darth Vader This place made the whole HongKong trip worth itFood costly so carry some snacksVisit on weekdays to avoid rush Do have the train ride,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"421737079,5,2016-9,United Kingdom,""I'm 22 and went with my partner and loved it! I have been brought up on Disney films so loved wondering round going on rides and singing the songs.I definitely recommend going on a weekday out of school holidays as there are very short queues, the maximum was 15 minutes for a couple of rides but many of them had no queue so we just kept going round several times until we were bored and moved onto the next one.My favourite rides were mystic manor which is really cool and the buzz lightyear one where you shoot targets which got very competitive between my partner and I! We managed to comfortably go on all the ride we wanted to within in a day and see one of the shows. I recommend planning your show times so your near the area for the time you want to go. The lion king show was great get there 10 minutes before the show time and good place to cool down in the middle of the day and escape from the heat! The food is pricey for HK although not ridiculous in comparison to European prices. We had no problem taking some of our own food in with us as long as it's not an excessive amount. Hence I recommend a big breakfast, by some bread from your local MTR and snacks to take with you and grab some dinner when your out of the park to save money. I have visited the Paris Disneyland a couple of times before and in comparison I found the parades disappointing. The 3pm only had 3 big floats and the nighttime villain parade only had 2 although they did a bit more of a show outside the front of the castle you need to be close to watch it. In Paris the parades were long and interactive, encouraging children into the parade for dancing and engagement which I liked, thus this was disappointing in comparison and the music was excessively loud!Another small disappointment was the lack of characters simply walking around in costume. I'm not sure if this is due to the climate in HK but in Paris one of the big things for children is getting characters to sign your autograph book which isn't a thing here at all! And in Paris you would spot characters all the time and easily be able to ask for an autograph or a photo where as in HK there is only a few booths with organised lines and limited times so very few opportunities for photos with the Stars which is a shame! I would definitely recommend staying for the fireworks which are done really nicely. TIP: get in front of the castle half an hour early and sit on the ground in the designated area for a clear view with no tall people blocking you! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"421122872,5,2016-9,Australia,""We visited the park over two days...Monday and Tuesday. There were virtually no line ups for any of the rides. From memory, Winnie the Pooh ride had the longest wait time (20 mins) on the day that we were there. But that depends on the time of the day as we went again late afternoon and there was no waiting at all.Over a couple of days we managed to go on all the rides several times. Managed to catch a couple of shows as well...The Lion King and Disney Wonderous Book shows are highly recommended. As is the Donald Duck 3D show.The options were not too bad either. A few options available from fried stuff, to asian cuisine and pasta. Expect to pay high prices but that is to be expected. Its not crazy expensive though.The 3pm parade was a little disappointing.The night time fireworks was OK.Overall we really enjoyed our 2 days at Disneyland and would recommend visiting the park on weekdays."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even the street peddler actually sells similar food, like turkey leg. Maybe all disneyland across the world having same kind of food. Surprisingly it's not as crowded as Tokyo's, and I covered all the rides in one day.The toilet pretty much well maintained, a lady will watch for every toilet and clean the stall once someone finish. But you can't avoid ill mannered tourist who doesn't know how to flush properly (and the toilet lady angry in cantonese).The most amazing thing there, I lost my passport. I went back a day after and successfully retrieve it without not much hassle. Note that they didn't allow selfie stick (I don't know why).

"419617467,4,2015-11,Hong Kong,""I have been there more than half a dozen times. Once inside, you feel like you are backtracked to childhood in a fairyland, regardless of age. You can smell it, hear it and see it. All the theme shows and activities are similar in Disneyland all over the world, but here in Hong Kong, you can do a lot more within a shorter period and save a lot of legwork. The floor design is very compact and you can go from one to the next within short distance. The parade is one of the best in the world and you must stay long enough to watch the fireworks at night, at around 8pm."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"419609295,2,2016-9,United States,""Visited Hong Kong Disneyland with my husband and three children, ages 7, 5, and 2. We had a beautiful, albeit very warm, day at the park. Having been to Disney World in Orlando several times, this park was much smaller scale and was a bit underwhelming by comparison. At the outset, we were frustrated because my husband purchased tickets to the park online upon our arrival at the park, and we were told we would have to wait one hour before we could gain entry, even though he had received a confirmation of purchase. Not what we wanted to hear when we had three eager children at the gates. We were really disappointed by the lack of characters to be found around the park. Plus, we tried to visit with Mickey and Minnie, Pluto and Jessie from Toy Story, and each time we were told to come back later, as they were closing for a break. It was a little frustrating that they don't have replacements available. We waited in long lines  generally 30 minutes to an hour for each ride  but we were there the day after a Chinese holiday so it is possible that we encountered higher than normal crowd volumes. This meant that in the 7 hours we stayed, we only rode 7 rides, and took one breaks for a beverage and one for lunch. In addition, they shut down three sections of the park at 4:30 for special events, which undoubtedly also contributed to overcrowding of the rides. The bad news covered, Toy Story Land was very unique and creatively designed, the park was well maintained, and the smaller size of the park made it manageable to navigate in one day, but I would not make a special effort to return."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
419368520,4,2016-9,Malaysia,It was a blazing hot summer during our visit. Not too many shady spots but was good to walk around. The free wifi was not strong all throughout the park. We took the MTR for the experience. Nice to have the train decorated ala Disney ears and characters. The park overall is not that big and probably can be covered in a day itself. There were just a decent number of rides for younger children. Food wise some restaurants were not opened throughout the park. We went to the one nearby Misty Manor which was great. Finding a table can be challenging so best to go after the peak meal times. There was a great sneak peak to the upcoming Halloween party in October which was really cool. Stay back for the fireworks! It's always the best way to end the visit. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yes it was tiring for the kids  rented a stroller for our youngest son but the older two walked the entire time. We were there from when it opened to about 5pm (nobody had the energy to stay any longer). Honestly my kids at this age could careless about the parade. The lines were not bad at all, the longest wait was probably 10 mins. DO get fast passes for Winnie the Pooh and Hyperspace mountain. You'd need to pre register for the Jedi training in advance (by hyperspace mountain and check the show times). Yes the rudeness of the mainlanders is not a myth....we've encountered a few pushes here and there to attempt to cut in front of us. Over all it is def doable to do everything in one day if you're an adult or coming with older children. Another note  my 4 yr old was tall enough to ride the hyperspace mountain but he DID NOT like the ride at all. Started crying in the middle of it (too dark fast). Would advise kids 5 and under to not ride this even if they are tall enough. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"419214633,4,2016-9,United Arab Emirates,""We couldn't get the best of Hong Kong Disney land as it rained on the day we visited. Ideally it is best to visit disneyland on weekdays as weekend will be busy with longer lines as more locals are expected to visit. Also check on the weather, if it rains they may not have few events happening or it may be a rainy day version.The best way to get to the Disneyland is by MTR and there is a dedicated train that gets you here. Upon entry do get a copy of Guidemap and Times Guide to plan your day and to get the best of it. Food can be expensive and they dont allow outside food unless you are smart enough to sneak through some light snacks and drinks. Don't miss the daily night fireworks atop the Sleeping Beauty Castle at 0730pm.The best way to get the best of the day is to plan and prioritize the rides and show you prefer and keep a track of the time.

"419192978,4,2016-9,United Kingdom,""It's a Disney theme park and really you get everything you would expect. Lots of Disney characters, plenty of zones, mixture of thrill rides, fun rides, children's rides, Disney shows, parades and fireworks. It is a lot of fun and since I am a big Star Wars fan the addition of this to Tomorrowland is a huge plus. When we visited the park (Sept) it was quiet as all the local schools were back and so we only had to wait 10 mins max for any ride and all the shows were easily available. Given how long the queues could be this was very welcome. We spent all day there and really enjoyed ourselves as two adults being big kids for the day. There are plenty of restaurants, food stalls and drink stands to choose from if the Park is busy. However they had shuttered a lot of these when we visited due to the lower visitor numbers making the choice somewhat more limited. I would have preferred a couple more  thrill  rides but this park does seem more aimed at smaller children than others I have been to. Also there is no alcohol anywhere in the park which is a shame as a cold beer would be very welcome given the heat. As mentioned above it does get hot in Hong Kong but there is a lot of shade and air conditioning around to make it more tolerable. So definitely worth a visit with kids or without and gives you that real Disney feel. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"418366832,5,2016-9,Oman,""Loved loved loved Disneyland. I have had the privilege of being to both Disneyland and Disneyworld and Disneyland HK (DHK) does not fall short in any way. I would say DHK is most ideal for families with young children. My 5 year old daughter is their ideal target audience and I dont think I have ever seen her soooo happy! She was captivated, mesmerized and then some more :)Lets start at the very beginning. It is possible to complete it in one day provided A. You come in off season and a week day. I imagine holiday time weekends will be jam packed.B. You buy the ticket before hand. We bought ours on klook.com (was 10% cheaper than what the official Disneyland site offers)C. You are there half hour before gate opening.As soon as you enter you will have the prized photo session with Mickey and Minnie. My suggestion is get that out of the way FIRST. The lines become manic for it later as the day progresses.Start at Fantasy Land   it has the most number of rides and shows on offer. The DHK app is fantastic and with the free wifi that is provided it is easy to track the waiting queues for each ride and plan accordingly.DHK also provide for something called a 'fast pass'. This allows you to stamp your card for a ride and it provides you a time slot for which you can cut all queues for that ride. However you can only use your fast pass for one ride at a time. Use it wisely :)Now for the shows   The variety of shows are limited but are spectacular and well worth watching! Factor in show timings when planning your day.You are allowed in food water from outside. If yiu have specific dietary requirements it may be best to plan ahead as the food menu options are limited. I would recommend 'banquet hall' in fantasy land as the place which offers the most variety. Special shout out to the toilets and the staff who keep them clean and non smelly despite the sheer volume of crowds!All in all   I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life and hope my daughter does too xx"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The weather said there will be breaks and the day started out as if there wouldn't be a dry time at all!The morning it was so wet! But no worries! With a light rain jacket everything is doable (it was especially easy for a couple without kids). The rain lessened and completely stopped! The lines were super short to all the rides! Yes it is a smaller park compared to others but coming at 12:30 and watching 2 different shows along with their night time fire work show at 7:30. We still rushed at the end to get our pictures and souvenirs. Don't underestimate how  small  it is. It is perfect for a whole day adventure.Do not miss the Mickey story book show. It was amazing! The production was great. (Subtitles are on the side for us English speakers) they did sing in English though. We also saw the lion king show and it was good as well.Their  5 min  wait at the rides was pretty walk on through. Giving those who wants to ride multiple times an easy to do.We had lunch to the food area next to the mystic mansion area (Sorry I forgot the name). But they had 3 different regions of food. We spent about 30 USD for 2 meals of Indian curry and tikka masala and their fried chicken with rice dish. Both was delish for a theme park meal! Tip: go on a weekday and a partly rainy day.

Whilst I do accept that maintenance is required this was on a very busy Saturday in July so it was rather annoying to pay over   50 for a ticket and not be able to experience the bigger rides.

But without a doubt the best thing about HK Disney is Mystic Manor! We thought it was going to be something like Haunted Mansion. But not at all. It is its own attraction that is absolutely amazing.

The train windows were in the shape of Mickey Mouse as were the hand rails   see photos attached. I believe the MTR cost us $45 from Tsim Shau Shu one way.We arrived at 9.45am and the park opened at 10am. The 'lands' don't open until 10.30am so the first 30 mins is for exploring Main Street and having photos with characters. For some bizarre reason, they stagger the land openings with half opening at 10.30 and the other half opening at 11.There were plenty of characters about to have photos with with waiting times of 10 15 min which isn't much if you've been to Orlando! We did all the rides but the top attraction for us was definitely the Geyser Gulch! There are FastPasses available for Winnie the Pooh and Hyperspace Mountain which you should take advantage of to skip the queues   speaking of queues, as we went during the week, we didn't wait longer than 15 min for any ride show.

Hong Kong was in a heat wave and we were not really complaining!We were not disappointed with Disneyland The trip by train is easy. Simply go down into the underground and if you get stuck or are a little nervous about traveling in a strange country, ask the staff. They are really good. The train is  pimped out  specifically and gets the young ones excited. Once you arrive, the processes to get in are great. I believe that it is easier to buy tickets on line before hand. Then you just have to verify once inside DL. Rides are great, food is nice but expensive. If price is an issue, shop around a bit inside as some places are more expensive than others. The place is spotless and I mean spotless. Not one tiny spec of rubbish anywhere. Staff are excellent and very friendly. Good grasp of english as you would expect in Hong Kong anyway.

"415778097,1,2016-8,Spain,""The park is far too small for the amount of people that are entering. There are long wait times and queues for everything. Security is a joke   they don't actually tell you anywhere what you aren't allowed to take in which means that nobody knows and this creates a huge queue with people asking why they can't enter with things and arguing about where they can leave things to collect them on the return. The queue management for everything is just a disaster from buying tickets, queuing to get in and out of the park and buying food   it's slow and badly organised and if you go in the summer most of the time you are waiting outside in 30 degree heat. No ideal at all. There aren't many rides and you can probably do every single ride in the park in half a day if there were no queues. There was always a queue for the toilet and they were not kept very clean at all. Food and drink is expensive so I would recommend that you took your own   make sure your drinks are in a plastic bottle. The metro station is about a 5 minute walk from the park and be warned that at the end of the day you will have to wait a long time in complete chaos just to get into the metro station. Not sure why Disney doesn't offer a bus service to the park entrance from the metro station and the buses that take you to the hotels. Buses to hotels were also a complete disaster. You have to wait again in a long queue and the bus stops at the Disney World hotel first and then moves on to the Hollywood Hotel. Not sure why they can't have separate buses as it just makes the journey so much longer. Park was a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Hong Kong has another theme park which is called Ocean Park. It's much better than Disney, better value for money and better organised.

It is like Disneyland in Anaheim, but with that jungle feeling, since it is in the middle of Lantau Island. Cheaper than US Disneys. The only negative side to it, it's that there are no memorable souveniers to bring back. We thought that there were going to be a lot of Chinese themed souveniers, but there weren't.

Take fast pass on the 2 rides where it is available to ensure you can finish others first. Grizzly gulch go for in the early morning to avoid queues.

They have two leaflets that are helpful: the Guide Map and the Times Guide. From these two, check which you like to visit, check the time sequence, and then plan accordingly. Just walking around the whole compound will take less than an hour. But stopping at shows, activities, meals, etc. may take a long time. With visited end of August and the queues ranged from 5 minutes to 20 minutes, but most were short. For small kids, the Jungle River Cruise is interesting. Mickey Mouse and the Wondrous Book was a good show, with high tech effects. Be ready for a lot of walking.

"414089027,4,2016-8,Indonesia,""This was my first Disneyland, and it was magical. Well, not really. I visited Disneyland just because I thought it was an obligation as a tourist in Hong Kong to visit Disneyland. Well, I chose a wrong day to visit. I went on Sunday morning when most of people were visiting Disneyland, in general I spent at least 20 minutes for a ride. The place was super crowded, but still manageable. Since it was summer, then you can imagine the heat. It was super hot. So prepare yourself additional t shirt and lots of water so you can refresh your self. Basically, all the rides were built for children and teenager. So for adult, you'll feel that all the rides were lame. But, for me as a non adrenaline junkie, this place was okay. As for the heat, you can always walk or wait your friends inside every store. Since there were so many Disney store in every ride, so you can hide and chill a little bit. They also have several restaurant and food stalls inside. And if you're a Muslim visitor, they also have a nice and proper prayer room inside. It is located in Mystic Point (if I was not wrong), just right next to the restroom. As I noticed, that not so many people know about this facility, since there was no one inside when I was there for more than 30 minutes.Overall, this place was worth to visit.

Even taking pictures with the characters. We stood 45 minutes in line to take a photo with mickey and minnie mouse. The characters in costumes keep taking breaks every 5 to 10 minutes probably because it's really hot and humid. They should have replacement people on rotation for how much they earn. Everything is overpriced and just full on capitalism and consunerism in all its glory. I paid 120 HKD for one helium balloon!!!! Only the food at this one Chinese noodle and rice place was reasonably priced. If your child is over 4 years old, well behaved, quiet, patient, won't drive you crazy trying to buy every Disney item, has no problem with heat humidity and rain, willing to walk by themselves everywhere then Disneyland hong kong is for you!

"413736816,3,2016-8,Australia,""We only had Wednesday afternoon evening to devote to Disneyland and worried that it wouldn't be enough time but as this really is only a very small mini park it was plenty of time. The longest we waited for a ride was 15mins and that was in Toy Story Land waiting for the Slinky Dog Spin which once we got on lasted for around a minute. Most of the other rides we simply walked right on and even ran back around and did them again as there was hardly anyone around.You don't have to stay at the resort but of course you will have to add travel time to your day. We caught the MTR to Sunny Bay (Tung Chung line) and then changed to the Disneyland Resort line which is a bit of fun as the Disney train has Mickey Mouse windows, Mickey ear handles to hold on to and small statues of characters in the train.There are basically 3 thrill rides in the park   RC Racer, Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars and even then they aren't that scary. The rest are cute family style rides like Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh & Jungle Cruise which are still fun just don't expect it to be like Disneyland USA. There are actually not that many rides in the park which is why we were able to get through them all, instead there's a real emphasis on meeting characters. One thing here is that they close the rides an hour before the park closes and the train closed at 6pm which is a shame so make sure you have done all the rides you want and then shop in the stores while you wait for the fireworks which are best viewed from Main Street facing the castle.A fun few hours and if you had small kids it would probably be a great day out but I'm not sure how people spend more than a day here."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

As the weather is very hot there were some areas in the park that had a lacking of trees   shade which made it tough to stay there for long. Example the toystoryland There was no proper sitting area to watch the fireworks at night so most people especially the ones in front had to sit on the road which was scorching hot from the sun earlier in the day. It was still radiating of heat at nightQuality of food was not great that the theme park especially those covered by the hotel park package. The Dim sums at Plaza Inn near the main street was good. The wanton noodles at Chopin food festival was bad. Photo plus option for tourists was really good to allow visitors to download professional photos with the characters later at their own time.Toilets were surprisingly clean which I was very happy with.Overall it might be the weather that spoilt it for me but I wasn't overly impressed with the HK Disneyland. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our group (my husband, myself, our daughter and granddaughter) enjoyed substantial savings on the tickets which were purchased at the airport.The visit was my daughter's birthday gift to her three year old daughter who is very fond of Sofia the First, the cartoon character. To really maximize the time, families should have a plan prepared ahead so it will help if one visited the website so they can prepare a list of the the attractions, the photo ops areas and the rides, each with a priority number assigned. The queues to some of the rides can have a waiting time of 60 to 70 minutes each, some have 10 to 15, so the priority listing can be your guide which attractions you can skip or not.Just to queue for the Mickey and Minnie mouse photo ops, we had to spend at least 2 hours in the open sun lining up on the queue.

We bought our tickets on the KLook App and we entered using the app which made it simple and quick. Once in the park all our door attractions were closed due to the cyclone so only indoor rides were open. This meant unless you were early there would be queues.

Despite the warm weather, we still enjoyed the rides, the shop discounts, the amazing parades and of course, the fireworks. It was worth the price. I suggest that you buy your tickets ahead of time to avoid long queue. Tickets are available in 711 stores. All you have to do is go to the machine near the entrance to get your ticket pass and you are in! Also note that selfie sticks are not allowed inside the park. Better be there early for 1 day is not enough to enjoy all the attractions. We are definitely coming back! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
412691290,5,2016-8,Australia,This was my first visit to a Disneyland anywhere in the world and I admit I was just as excited as a little kid. Initially disappointed that there wasn't a castle out the front but found out later it was inside the park   happiness restored. Gardens are lovely and the park area is clean. Biggest downfall is the sheer number of people   be prepared to lose hours out of your day if you want to do anything like go on rides or have photos taken with the Disney characters. A lot time is taken up standing in line waiting   60 minutes was the average the day I went. Train station near the front gate makes transport to from the park very easy. Lots of places to eat with a variety of choices. Mickey shaped pizza and ice cream is a must. Loved it.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We were shocked after our tour guide Frank Law dropped us off. We thought they were closed because of how empty the parking lot. The financial loss of Disney was our family gain in that we had very little waiting we had. We rode all of the rides, several more than once, and never waited longer than 15 20 minutes.

Highlight was that you can find many eating places, chinese, halal, malaysian, indian etc. Reasonably priced.

"411865499,5,2016-8,United Kingdom,""The trick here is to get there early and if you can do it on an overcast day the crowds will be thinner...we only had to queue for the Hyper space mountain ( for one hour) but the other rides we barely queued at all  result!The children (age 8) loved it, it is pretty compact so not to tiring to walk around, and each zone offers different views and experiences. We went on around 8 rides, stopped for lunch ( Maxims run Chinese restaurant, set menu  quite pricey but everywhere is!) and watched the parade for a bit. We arrived at 11 and left at 4 and that was long enough for us. I was ready to do it for the kids, but ended up really enjoying it, if you embrace the whole Disney thing and go with it, it's sweet and wholesome and good fun.We loved Hyper space mountain, we loved Grizzly bear gulch so much we did it twice ( no queue so ran back around!)

So every visit is like a new visit.Since my last visit, several new attractions like the Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point have opened. Grizzly Gulch is an old wild west mining town complete with a Geyser and a mining car ride (Geyser Gulch) while Mystic Point is a mysterious area with gardens full of optical illusions and a mysterious manor.Of course, the usual attractions and shows like Adventureland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Toy Story Land, Main Street USA etc. and the night time fireworks show remain as exciting as ever and are always worth a second visit.So whether you are visiting for the first time or you visit it regularly, Disneyland always has something new for you.

"411439783,4,2016-8,Australia,""Didn't know what to expect having never been to a Disneyland before, but it was quite a good experience. Probably a better experience for young children as opposed to teenagers, just because there were fewer rides, and more attractions that you just walked through  looked at that would possibly entertain a child's imagination better. I loved how in theme all the 'lands' were   obviously no expense was spared. The lion king show was unbelievable, we were thoroughly impressed, and were very disappointed that the Mickey Mouse show that also ran filled up before we got to see it. The parade was also great, but we found the choice of food a bit lacking. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"411317765,5,2016-5,Australia,""We had a wonderful time at Hong Kong Disneyland. We spent one full day there with our kids and experienced everything pretty much. It is much smaller than Disney in California but just as special. Some different rides to experience and smaller lines which was great compared to America. We still love Disney California better as much larger and more to offer, but we thoroughly enjoyed Hong Kong Disney all the same. The evening parade is not to be missed. Totally amazing. The food in the restaurants was great but very pricy. To be expected I guess, but it was a treat to have mickey mouse shaped vegetables, nuggets and waffles."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"411249075,4,2016-8,Hong Kong,""We took our relatives with young children to visit the park, they absolutely loved it, the comments are very positive. However, there are some small details worth addressing to: 1) the bar code scanning for mobile phone (non paper) is not working easily, which slowed down the speed at the entrance and caused a longer line. Suggest to give a separate queue line for the scanning. 2) we cannot find out the  meeting with the character  time schedule easily, not on line anyway. 3) Selfie sticks are banned, but we still saw the visitors using them in the park. How does the park enforce the rules? 4) Chinese mainland tourists usually like to jump the queue and ignore the stopping line even, we saw at one occasion one man with a kid jumping over a blocking line for crowd control but no one stopped them.

"411130071,4,2016-7,United States,""   ll preface this with admitting that I love all things Disney. I am an American and I have been to both Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World many times over multiple decades. I   ve also been the Disneyland Paris (but that was 15 years ago   ..). I was traveling for work and had the opportunity to spend 2 days at Disneyland. This review is of the park itself without taking into consideration hotels, transportation or other things that may exist at one of the USA resorts. It is strictly a review and some comparisons to other versions of the Disneyland park or the    Magic Kingdom    as it is called in Florida. When you arrive, it   s very similar, you go under the train station and you are on Main Street. It looks very similar to the USA parks where there is Town Hall and a Fire Station on the left and the Emporium and some different stores on the right. To me, the castle is identical to that of Disneyland in California. I found the guests do not linger in stores or on Main Street like they do in the USA, the queue for rides was moderate, yet the Main Street area seemed empty. HK Disneyland was missing some of the classic attractions I love from USA parks   Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain, People Mover, Mr. Toad, Peter Pan and surprisingly, Pirates of the Caribbean (would have thought with the international success of the movie they   d have this one). The classics that do exist are Hyper Space Mountain (which is FAR superior to either USA version)"; Small World (same exterior as Disneyland in CA), Railroad, Festival of the Lion King (which is at Animal Kingdom in USA) and Mickey   s Philharmagic. These rides are pretty much the same as in the USA with the exception of Space Mountain, which is a lot smoother and is themed to Star Wars. The Haunted Mansion is repurposed as    Mystic Manor    and was in my opinion, a totally different ride. It was a track style moving ride through a museum using the same type of ride vehicles as Toy Story Mania in USA. It was cute   but definitely not in any way the same as Haunted Mansion. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine car seems like a cross between Big Thunder Mountain, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Expedition Everest (from Disney World). I really liked this ride. Toy Story Land was my favorite part of the park in part because it does not exist in the USA parks. The attention to detail was amazing. It had a small roller coaster for young kids that looked like a slinky dog;" a high drop ride based on the parachuting green army men and a few other things. Really well designed. For people worried about a language barrier   there isn   t one. Signage is predominantly in English with Chinese underneath. All cast members spoke English. All the narration I heard was in English too (ie: Mickey   s Philharmagic is entirely in English   there is zero difference in the ride in Hong Kong versus USA). I was sort of surprised how prominent English was (being in Hong Kong afterall   ). The food definitely had more of an Asian flair, which is not to say you couldn   t get a hamburger or hot dog. Each restaurant had a covered cart out front that had a sample of each meal prepared. I liked this option because it gave me a better idea of a food if I wasn   t familiar with the name. I loved the nighttime parade      Paint the Night   , very colorful, lots of lights. The fireworks show was good too. Overall, the park itself can easily be done in a day, not sure the square footage but it seemed about the size of the Magic Kingdom in USA   maybe a little smaller. I definitely felt like the crowd was a bit younger. Didn   t see a lot of families with teenagers. Mostly kids under 10 or so. I was pleasantly surprised with how well behaved the kids were   almost never saw anyone crying or having a temper tantrum. All in all, I enjoyed Hong Kong Disneyland and if you are a Disney fan in Hong Kong and can spare a day   I recommend a visit."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;

"410345783,3,2016-8,United States,""The Hong Kong Disney is rather small compared to the Orlando one. Our 10 year old did not complain about walking from one attraction to another because they are right next to each other. Waiting time wasn't too bad. Since we got there early and did the hyper space mountain ride and the buzz lightyear first we didn't use any fast pass. Theme park staffs was polite. We bought the admission tickets from one website and received a small discount. We bought the meals vouchers from the entrance for lunch, dinner and a snack. It was a good deal. Food portion was big. We should have bought just three in stead of four because we couldn't finish the food. One thing I didn't like was that it was difficult to look for a table to dine. You MUST find a table before buying food. No one cleans up after they eat so the table was dirty until the staff removed the trays and wiped the table clean. I have to give credit to the staffs because they work extremely hard to keep the park clean and tidy. Despite this, Hong Kong Disney is noisier and dirtier compared to Orlando's.

The queues were very long and even my teens were not prepared to stand in lines for a ride. The minimum waiting time was, approximately 1 hour. Small but will be tons of fun for parents of smaller kids. The Disney parade was exciting and to see the awe in the kids faces were amazing. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"409098932,4,2016-8,Singapore,""This is the first disneyland I've been to and I love the entire experience!Despite the massive amount of people, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The weather was crazy hot but it didn't kill the fun, at least it's not raining since it's the typhoon season in HK. We queued no more than 30 mins for the rides which was quite amazing considering the fact that we went on a Saturday. All the character meet and greets were superrrrr fun, I really loved the vibes, just wished I didn't go in summer. Basically, I feel that it's worth going but here are some advice.My advice:  Have a really full breakfast, the food is really expensive there. Only the sandwich is affordable.   Go on a weekday  Don't go in summer   Go really early in the morning like once the gates are open, run!  Go to the most popular rides first like the roller coasters   Take photos with the main characters";" Mickey and Minnie at the town square because the queue's pretty insane when the humans flood in.   For the shows (Lion king Mickey), go there like 45 mins to 1 hour before the show actually starts.   Fireworks starts at 8:30pm, be at the town square at 8pm or even earlier to grab a good spot for amazing magical moments!Definitely going to visit other disneylands after this trip!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

"409044714,3,2016-8,Vietnam,""Very good decorations, our kid loved parade and the firework. However had some poor organized moments. 1. You should be to queue a loooot. Like from 10am till 8.20 we just managed to get into 5 attractions and took a photo with Mickie. If you want to eat, again... And if you want to find a sit you should be lucky to fine one. Why not to make electronic queueing system? Considering that ticket is not cheap. 2. The tropical sun is to strong to handle. Would be good to have some shades. For train they made us to queue outside the roof covered area referring to instruction. So eventually after a long day you feel exhausted and realize that you missed the feeling of magic at all. Because thats why people usually go there for I think. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"409011887,4,2016-5,Hong Kong,""If you have been to other Disneyland Parks you will see that this one looks and feels like the others, but it is unique and different in other ways. First it is smaller and easier to get around. The park can be done in a day, or 2 3 if you are really into the rides. It is easy to get to from public transportation   bus, taxi or MTR. Lines for specific rides or activities can get long. It is best to go during the week, and in the morning when it first opens. They have regular updates to the rides, with the newest one being the addition of Star Wars and the soon to be completed Iron Man ride. I don't love amusement parks (lines, prices, etc), but this was a really easy and fun day for our child. Sometimes sacrifices must be made. :)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The second day was rainy day so the weather was a much better. We liked Mickey's new show the wondrous book but it was in Chinese and the translation was placed up we couldn't catch up with both the characters moving and the translation was up there. But it was a very nice show the kids loved it. We liked the parade my daughter got a vip pass very important princess. We really had a great time!

Space mountain is all star wars themed at the moment. Mystic point which is a purely built for HKG was amazing   such a unique attraction and made it worth visiting the park.. Favourite ride was the runaway mine cart ( this also had a single rider line   maybe the only one in the park??) If looking for disney stuff in the shops, don't hold your breath too much... its not 'disney' disney in terms of heaps of mickey and donald and goofy etc.. had more zootopia, big hero 6 and other disney toys . Which made it feel more like a giant toy shop than a disney store.   had your t shirts and mugs as well though.Didnt really see any characters around the park, Did see MIckey as was exiting at main square though... wasnt really looking, but wasn't really advertised either.All in all   was glad I went, but wouldnt go to this park again.

So lots of shops to buy Disney souvenirs. It's very exciting walking along the really long entrance towards the gate with a fabulous Mikey surfing   which I thought strange in Hong Kong but cool nevertheless. The castle was disappointing compared to USA but then again you can't expect the exact same thing, so I could deal with that. I just didn't get the Disney kid feeling in my gut! The parade was pretty spectacular, we all loved that. My kids thought it was great but got over it pretty quick! The rides kept closing due to fear of lightning or storms and with the size of the queues the kids said they wanted to leave. No real exciting rides really. No express passes to jump the queue either! You could get them for individual rides if busy but no express queue. We tried to get lunch and that was another effort   no theme park type food available most places were closed and we waited in line to a restaurant which had a bazaar menu and no tables to sit at. So we had fairy floss for lunch! So to some up if your in Hong Kong give it a go for something to do! But don't compare to other parks as you will be disappointed!

Check with the programme guide as some parts can be closed for restoration.There was a smaller procession with a band and the characters in addition to the main parade with gave plenty of photo opportunities.

The prices are so much be. I think it was close to $60 vice $100 in California. go early and go to the back of the park first. We went around 1030 and went by the small world attraction.

The other attractions at HKDL were familiar from the other parks, so there is not much more to elaborate on.

To me it felt like it was missing a couple of exciting adult rides. The park itself is quite small and you can get around within 4 5 hours so it seemed to be better to go later in the day so that you could stay for the late show.Souvenirs were more for kids and greatly lacking in adult gifts, like glass items or other collectibles, couldn't even find any snowglobes.This place is an alcohol free zone also"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was after receiving feedback from some friends, so I was very pleasantly surprised. It isn't as big or impressive as the American locations, but it's still brilliant! My only gripe would be the lack of eating establishments. The first restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed, as was the next one, and the one after that! So the remaining restaurants were really busy and it was hard to find a table. Unfortunately the evening parade we were looking forward to was cancelled because of the weather, but we'd already see a superb Lion King performance so we weren't too disappointed.

"406843321,1,2016-8,China,""Below was the email I sent to Disney Customer Service, your Director of Guest Experience Services Janet promised to contact me within 5 days BUT she DID NOT. Dear Sir or MadamI am writing this email after my recent depressing and discouraging visit to Hong Kong Disneyland with my mom and my daughter Emma dated 2 Aug 2016. It took several days for me to make this formal complaint because I want to make sure I was not outrageous for the time being but disheartened for good. I do hope you can take some of your time and hear out the story of what happened to us back then.We are Chinese citizens coming from Hainan Province. My daughter is four years old, and she is extremely eager to meet the princesses in person and take photos with them. Hong Kong Disneyland increased the price and Shanghai Disneyland recently opened notwithstanding, we still chose to visit Hong Kong Disneyland because we saw your MARVELOUS advertisement of your wonderful 10 YEARS ANNIVERSARY. We stayed in Hong Kong over the night of 1 Aug and arrived at the Park around 10:30 the next day. However, one hour after our check in when we are queuing up for the raft to the Tree House of Tarzan, the staff dismissed the queue and informed us that all the outdoor activities will be cancelled due to the  3 storm signal. No Cinderella. No Snow White. No Elsa. No Aurora. No Rapunzel. No parade. You cannot imagine how dispiriting and frustrating it was for the 4 year old little girl.It was the first time for Emma to visit an amusement park of its kind. To make this trip colourful and meaningful for her, I spent 8 weekends watching the Disney classic movies with Emma, especially the Disney Princess collections. We chatted over night to discuss which princess she liked the most. We played games together to recreate the scene of each princess movie. Unfortunately, it just turned out that the more you longed for meeting the princess, the more disappointing you got.From then on, at least 3,000 visitors thronged in door and heavily queued up for the only programs left over. We spent at least one and a half hour waiting for the small world. What is worse that we were informed that the park would be closed shortly due to the  8 storm signalI could not just believe it. The dinner was off the record because all canteens and shops in the park shut their doors suddenly. With no restaurants nearby, I had to bring little Emma of 4 and my mother of over 60 back to the downtown without dinner. Not to mention how disappointing we were leaving without seeing the fireworks.I know you would defend yourself using the typhoon excuse, and it is very true, nobody will deny it. Nevertheless, it is your cold heartedness and your negligence that irritate me. Nobody even showed the slightest care for the little boys and girls and the aged. YOU just THREW us out, which is the last thing I can imagine to happen in Hong Kong Disneyland. I cannot understand it and will not accept what had just happened to us. With the modern technology, you should know the typhoon is coming and you know much better than anybody exactly how it will affect the park. It seems to me that you just care more about the number of visitors rather than their expectations and experiences. Maybe you could close the Park for good and post an advance notice, or you could pretend to be sorry and try to be a little bit nicer to your guests, but you chose to do nothing. Oh, I am sorry that you did do something when you made a great effort to kick them out.I chose Hong Kong Disneyland over Shanghai because I believed your 10 years anniversary will be more wonderful than usual";" because I believed your staff will be more civilized and more experienced, so that my daughter will enjoy her meeting with princess more happily. Sadly, it is such a fool of me to have believed all this and none of it came true. Of course, it is surely not a trip of empty hand. I   ve learned my lessons: never trust the illusory advertisement. I would love to share my experience with my friends and colleagues who just happen to have kids of the same age like Emma, and I am confident they must be smart enough to learn from mistakes and make correct decisions. Thank you very much for your wonderful service offered to Emma, and she will definitely not badger me again to bring her to any Disneyland around the globe."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

Both days we had a lot of rain and purchased umbrellas and still comfortably walked the park. 2 full days and I think we still missed 1 3rd of rides shows. The food wasn't overpriced and we took our own water in. The gift shops are expensive and lack Disney products outside of princesses and toy story. We wanted to get zootopia and lion king merchandise but there was either limited or none. Recommend the 2 day pass, we are a family of 3 (husband, myself and a 7 year old).

If you're looking for thrill rides this isn't the place with only 4 so so thrill rides. More suited to the younger kids than teens or adults looking for action like the Aneheim Disney.The street parade is a revisited child hood and was very good. Anouncements are given in Cantonese and EnglishEasy to get to once to work out the MTR $28.50HK to get there and $534HK for adult entry. The park had a no selfie stick policy which they don't enforce and they have dmoking areas behind a screen so if you walk by you still get second hand smoke. What they should have is a no mobile policy. Never have encountered any where in the world an culture so self absorbed pushy and rude. Park visitors can't walk around without their noses in mobiles, so they walk into people, hold up lines, push in front of you and watch out for how they also wield umbrellas if you value your eye sight. We were feed up by days end having to deal with such self centred behaviour. It was a real dampner on the day. If the mobile meet work went down they wouldn't know how to cope. Why go to Disneyland if you're going to spend the day looking at your mobile. Take your own food and drinks or you'll end up broke or have someone push into you while you're trying to get out the exit line balancing your tray and risk loosing the lot over someone.

The attractions are very nice and take you back to your childhood times. Even it was a rainy day during my visit I did attend all attractions in addition managed to take a pictures with Mickey and Mimi."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
404554238,4,2016-8,Australia,When comparing this to Orlando and lots Angeles parks it's a very mini version. But in saying that we still managed to have a great day and with it being smaller we actually found it much easier to cover the whole park. Things can still be expensive in the park but not overly huge hikes in prices. Take the mrt if you are staying anywhere near a station as it's the cheapest and probably also the quickest way. If you have a child s that enjoy Disney you will definately have a great day out.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"404123435,4,2016-8,Malaysia,""This month of Hong Kong Disneyland trip is very  hot . (It is advise that don't come during hot weather, if you don't like hot day like me). Since bring kids, the most important is to go for 2 show, which is about the Lion king and the Mickey Mouse theater. Attraction will be the afternoon parade and the nite parade. Station that must not miss will be the  small small world ,  toy story with buzz ,   the story of Winnie the Pooh . At night the fire cracker show is not my kids favorite, so during the fire cracker show, we actually having our late dinner in the restaurant. Is great to have dinner during that time because the Disneyland MTR actually crowded with people. After our dinner, no need to queue at the MTR, this will be more easy for us (parent) that bringing 2 kids around. Overall this place still nice, but need to choose during cold weather. I don't like hot !

If you go here are the rides you should hit first.Mystic Manor: Best ride out of all of the Disneys!Space Mountain: STARWARS    You should try to do most of the rides because all of them are absolutely astonishing!NOTE: Toy Story land gets crowded when the weather is good.*Wish they had fast passes for more than 2 rides * "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
404025535,3,2016-8,Thailand,I have been here before and it was just not the same. The crowds are much bigger and the wait is too long. There are no trees so there is no shelter from the hot sun! The staff are not as friendly as they used to be and they did not try to understand that the temperatures were high and they could easily have hurried the pace between rides if they managed it properly. Also they never filled up all the rides and a lot of rides had only two or three people where 4 or 5 could easily have gone. The only good thing was they had a fast tract where you could punch your ticket and were given a time to come back for that particular ride. Though the time given was 4 or 5 hours after it still meant that we did not have to wait under the hot sun.The parade only starts at 7:30 PM and the light show at 9 PM!!!We were there from 1000 AM and there was no way our children could stay awake that late.They should look at having these two much earlier.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We really enjoyed some rides we can't enjoy in the states, including Mystic Manor and Big Grizzly Mountain. The park is very easy to get around";" it's similar to Disneyland in Anaheim in the sense that it's just one park and you don't have to go to multiple park entrances like you do at Disney World. The food at HK Disney is super unique! Most places serve rice or noodle dishes and dim sum. Try the korean squid! Parade and fireworks at night were spectacular! Getting to the park is very easy by MTR. The train is even decorated with Disney memorabilia. Overall, wonderful experience! Highly Recommend! If visiting in hot weather, bring an umbrella.

The castle was pretty small... but maybe that's just me. There's no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which is a shame, but otherwise the rides are a lot of fun.

However I feel something difference about the services. Not many staffs around, not many photographs taken to be deemed in photostore booth, some staffs a bit not friendly nor helpful. I saw a father got mad to a staff, complaining why his kid cannot took a photo with mickey while he already stood in the line but the photo session time was up.

And since I love Disney, I make it a point to visit Disneyland every time we go to Hong Kong. We usually arrive there at around 10:00 am. We go this early because there are shorter lines. Once you get it Disney it is best if you go straight to fantasyland and all those rides before taking pictures with characters along the way. Although there are water fountains scattered around the area it would be best to bring water bottles since water is a bit pricey there. The meals are great as well. Very delicious for a theme park. The bathrooms and facilities are clean and well maintained. So yeah. I really enjoyed my time there. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is a light show at 9pm which was great. The queues weren't too bad on the Thursday when we went. You have to be prepared to eat there, which adds to the cost. The kids both did Jedi knight training on stage with my son successfully slaying Darth Vader! They had photos taken with Chewbacca and Mini mouse (not together), and enjoyed some rides. Two of the rides are fast and come with warnings on the physical nature, such as sudden jolts, so some options for older kids. There was no roller coaster for young kids. One ride, Mystic Manor, was quite scary for the kids but great fun. If you go in August, go when you know the weather is good, we had to plan around Typhoon Nida's arrival!

"402108584,4,2016-4,Canada,""We have been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney World, and Paris Disneyland. We always find the parks to be a fun day trip. First off, Hong Kong Disneyland is a smaller park compared to the others. It's a park that you can feel accomplished at in only one day. We were able to ride attractions multiple times even though the park seemed packed. The park has many of the classics: Winnie the Pooh, Tea Cups, Railroad, Cinderella Carousel, Space Mountain and the Jungle River Cruise. Big Grizzly Mountain was closed during our visit, which was unfortunate as I like Thrill Rides. The best   and I mean THE BEST attraction at Disneyland Hong Kong is Mystic Manor. We rode it 6 times throughout the day. Despite the park being busy, we never waited longer than 10 minutes in line. This ride is a MUST. Although not my favourite Disney park, it's a good visit.

If this is your first time visiting a Disneyland and never been to any before, you surely will be left in amaze and wow.But after been to several DL around the world, I had to say, this is one of the  smaller  version with shorter rides. It's tough call esp after you've visit several better ones around the world.

402067824,3,2016-8,China,A real disappointment. It has couple downs in my view:1. It searches customers bags for food! We thought it's for security but turned out they search your hand bags coz too many Chinese bring in food to avoid rip offs. Felt really bad that they worry more about their profits than our safety!2. A total rip off  we were encouraged by Disney Hollywood at check out counter to bring our bags with us to use the luggage locker  service  in Disney. Turned out its a HK$90 piece  service . A guy in front of us has a glass bottle of water. The  security  forced him to put it in a locker n paid HK$90. Not to mention food n drinks there are 4 5 times more than market prices.3. Dirtiest restrooms: you can smell them miles away. Toilet seats r worn with footprints. I understand there have been tons of Chinese tourists but the management can at least clean them more frequently.4. Terrible service: It rained heavily one hour before Lion King show. All rides were closed. Tons of people had no places to go but were waiting in line. The management just kept we all in the rain for full one hour. They could have opened the room and let us wait inside. Previous show is done 2 hours ago n we know the performers were in another show so the room was empty. 5. Limited rides: there r really not many rides. Only 3 4 rides in each  land . Fire works last for 10 seconds. U can finish all rides in one day incl 30 60 mins waiting for each ride.Go only if your kids like Disney but u don't want to spend too much time. Be prepared to be pushed n cut in line by Chinese. Shows may stops at anytime too due to too many Chinese uses flash lights...,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Food stands were better and cheaper,...I ate before I got there so only snacked. Every ride and theatricals are included in your entry price and at the end of every ride you walk out into a shop of souvenirs but save your buying until the end otherwise you have to carry it around and the shops stay open for a short while after the fireworks. The parade in the day was fun and the night one was fabulous. The fireworks at the end was worth the wait and a good tip is is to position yourself straight after the night parade for the best view.

So you can cover almost 90 % of the rides and stage shows in like one day itself.. ( do go for the single rider option...

"400528270,5,2016-7,United Kingdom,""Getting there : firstly I want to make it clear that I am rubbish at public transport and always panic  get lost . But on the advice of everyone we got the MRT there and it was super easy . The trains are air coned , clean and easy navigate . The people move out of the way so you can board and lots of workers in the station speak English so there is always someone to help and EVERYONE know how to get to Disney . The Park : obviously it is much smaller than its American counter parts but none the less magical , there a few rides for adults , they have their own space mountain and a runaway train . Been smaller it works better for younger children than the huge American parks as there is less walking . It has all the usual Disney charm and places to eat . Food is not that expensive inside and even the most expensive sit down place is not more than   15 each for a decent meal and drink . Because the park is smaller when you get a fast pass for the rides you are only waiting 15 mins maximum and to see the fireworks , everyone gets to be close to the castle . There are no vip slots , or pushing like other parks . This isn't the biggest park with the best rides , but it's still magic and easy to get too . The ticket price is cheaper than most , and you only need to go ONE day , do not go more than one as there isn't enough things to go and you'll be waiting your money ! Enjoy if you go ! Ps you must go see the lion king show it's free and on a west end production scale , turn up 15 minutes early , it's also air coned so it's a great break for the children from the heat !"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

When we were waiting in line for a ride, I requested the attendant if we can come ahead in the line as we have a disabled child. She said that we need to provide proof that the child is disabled and need to bring a letter from City Hall that the child is disabled. I said we are tourist, we dont live in HK, how can we bring letter from HK City Hall? She said then we cannot get ahead in the line. My child was in a wheel chair and he has Down's Syndrome.

"400226959,4,2016-6,United States,""We are frequent visitors of Disney World and so opted to visit HK Disney while in HK for a different experience. The park is definitely smaller than WDW or even Disneyland in California. We went mid week in June and there were no lines. I attribute some of this to the language barrier, but I felt it missed some of the Disney Magic. For example, the afternoon parade was non existent. We arrived at 10, many rides didn't open until 11. We rode almost every ride, some 2 or 3 times. Kids have new favorites, Mystic Manor and Grizzly Gulch. My kids are half Chinese so really enjoyed a little Asian flair to the park. It was very easy to get to on the MTR and was a great day trip but I would not go out of my way to travel to HK to go here.

It's really a perfect place for kids and on my case kids at heart. If you're not really a fan of rides then 1 whole day is enough to experience the theme park. My personal favorite of all the rides is the Space Mountain an indoor roller coaster, like I could ride it again and again. Oh, and  It's a small world  is just too cute! Also I watched the Festival of the Lion King, a show where they feature the story and the songs of the Lion King of course. To complete the Disneyland experience, watch the fireworks display and make sure to find the perfect spot to watch the fireworks display."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"399972092,4,2016-7,Israel,""This Disneyland harbors only a small number of attractions for teens, and the number of shops and restaurant surpasses the number of attractions. For example, there were only two roller coasters.

Shade was in shortage, and the hot day made the experience quite sticky."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"399747231,2,2016-6,Indonesia,""We visited HK Disneyland in the month of July, I'm guessing it was school holidays in neighbouring China, so there were hoards of Chinese tourists. The queues were Long and we had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes for each ride, the queues were very badly managed by the Disneyland authorities. Some of the quiet were suffocating as there were no fans even and hardly any place to stand due to the winding queues. To add to it, the Neighbouring crowd were very noisy and had total disregard for others, and were happily cutting queues at every opportunity without any guilt or consideration for young kids who were standing on the line.We managed only a few rides for our 7 year old Daughter due to the Long queues, however the evening parade and the fireworks display was a treat to watch and made up for the day's misery."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

More justified reason now that I have a little toddler who loves princess as much as I do! It was truly magical! Everything about it is magical! If you're going with family and young children, I would say this is the best Disneyland resort to go as most of the attractions are perfect for kids below 5 years old but make no mistake, it also has attractions for adult like raft and all. It was rather unfortunate that we didn't see the fireworks when we were there because we've arrived in disney resort quite early so we didnt think we could stay longer. We will certainly take this into account for next Disneyland destinations. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
399501015,3,2016-7,Australia,Visited last week....very easy to get to on MTR. Good day out but found only 2 big rides....most all for the little ones. Merchandise shops dominate this Disneyland.

399489021,4,2016-7,India,We went to Disneyland with our 8 year old and she loved the whole experience. We took the 2 day pass and meal coupons. It is a bit difficult to cover most of the rides and character meetings in one day. We did most of the rides on day 1 and some rides and a lot of character meetings on day 2. The meal and beverage coupons are really good since you get much better value for what you pay. You can however take a few water bottles and some snacks into Disneyland specially if you have kids with you. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"399370012,2,2016-7,Japan,""We live in Japan and decided to hop over to Hong Kong and check out Hong Kong Disneyland. We went to Hong Kong Disneyland with two kids ages 7 and 4. The actual entrance is down a long pathway that takes 10 minutes to get to from the hotel drop off point. We were told the park opened at 10:30 so we arrived 45 minutes before rope drop time. But we when got there, people were already allowed into the park. Which was strange. We went on a weekday and even though the park opened at 1030. Toy Story land didn't open until 11 and closed early at 8. Many restaurants were closed but we weren't sure if they were closed because it was a weekday. We wanted to eat at Explores Club restaurant but it didn't open until 12. We notice many snack food stands did not open until 12. We rented a stroller inside the park which cost $100HKD   $100HKD deposit you will get back when you return the stroller. If you want to do Jedi Training for ages 4 12 do the sign up first thing when you get in because it will get full. We bought tickets at DisneyLand Hollywood Hotel the night before. We generally don't go to the most popular rides first we went until the end of the night when the crowds die down and there isn't a huge wait. One of the most popular rides is The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh that is also a FP but we opted to go right after the night parade and the wait was only 15 minutes. The Buzz Light Year ride we went right before the firework show at 8:50 and there was no wait. The kids loved ToyStory land and went right when it opened at 11 and we waited only 5 minutes for the rides. You are allowed to bring in food and drinks. Personal space does not exist and people will be literally on top of you when you are in line. We watched Festival of the Lion King which is great and we waited outside. We didn't understand why we couldn't wait inside the air conditioned theatre. People will try and cut in line so beware. Our little 4 year got pushed by adults because she walked too slow. We had to carry her prior to waiting for shows because she almost got trampled. Would I recommend going to Hong Kong Disneyland? No. If you have a chance go to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea. Even though it crowded people are polite and wait their turn. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"399290765,3,2016-7,Italy,""I'm sure that this Disney is a bit smaller than the one in Florida. But the entrance costs seemed lower so I cant complain. Lots of the usual Disney things to do but the staff here didn't seem as slick as Florida staff were. Having the MTR take you straight there was good, but definitely buy them before you go as the queues were long and it was hot. We bought ours earlier in the day at the Hong Kong (not Central) MTR station   no queue.There was a good selection of food for most people, nice to see it also included Asian food and drink too.

The queues for the attraction were not too long, about 10 15 mins when we went.

"398996871,4,2016-7,Australia,""We bought a 2 day  4 night package to experience HK Disney. Having been to the original Disneyland and Disney World we had a fair idea of what we were in for. We were there on a Thursday Friday. The shuttle from the Disney Hollywood hotel was clean, cool and efficient. The wait to get through security was a little long...all up it took about 45 minutes of lining up to get through security then the gates with prepaid tickets. Upon entering the park you are instantly transported back to your childhood of Sunday nights in front of the tv watching Disneyland. Take the Disneyland express when you first enter the park. It's a bit of a wait but it gives you a great overview of the park before you begin. Perhaps because of local demand the Princesses don't seem to feature much. On our 2 days we only saw Elsa and Anna and Rapunzel. Tinkerbell was present as were Buzz Lightyear and Jessie and Andy's toy soldiers. Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto were available all day in different locations but we found the Asian market seems to prefer characters over Princesses. It was so very hot and we struggled with lack of seating and shade. While the lines for rides had fans misting fans should be around the park. The food options were very ordinary, meal deals or bundles being mostly on offer. It was difficult finding just chips or a light snack. We grew very tired as did our child of him being photographed. Being off season and with him being blonde blue eyed, we seemed to be the only westerners there and as such he was   fair game   to photographers. The Disney crew were very good at asking people waiting for character meet and greets to STOP taking pics of our little guy. We found that to be very invasive and really did affect our little mans enjoyment. Queue jumpers and pushing and shoving was also very tiring. Given HK Disneys proximity to Australia we found the lack of English understanding challenging. Chose your toilets carefully....some were so clean you could have eaten off them, others so filthy we walked straight out.The merchandise available was nothing exciting. Mainly toys in boxes that I could buy at my local department store. However they really need more staff serving in the various shops. We heard of people waiting for an hour in line to be served.The rides were pure Disney.....I can say no more than that. And after visiting Ocean Park where our 4 y o missed out on a lot because of his size, at HKD he was able to ride most things.The fireworks and light show projected onto the castle were phenomenal.So our 3rd Disney experience came to an end. Will we return....no   but did we enjoy it ? Yes !"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"398643226,5,2016-7,United Kingdom,""Don't believe anyone who says that Hong Kong Disneyland is too small boring. Having visited both Disney World and Disneyland Paris on multiple occasions, I can safely say that this was the best experience I've ever had at a Disney park. For July, the crowds were surprisingly small. We never had to wait more than 30 minutes to ride anything (even for Space Mountain & Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars!) We are used to peering over heads to watch the parades due to crowds, but we arrived at the parade route 5 minutes before and had an unobstructed view!! We were there from opening (10am) to closing (9pm) and still didn't manage to ride everything, despite the small queues! The only negative to the day was the heat, however queueing areas all had fans and were mainly undercover. With the opening of Shanghai Disneyland I can see why someone might think Hong Kong Disneyland is rather smaller in comparison, but I would still encourage you to visit. Some of the rides are identical to other Disney Parks (Toy Story Playland), some are similar but have some major differences (Space Mountain has a Star Wars theme) and some are completely original (Mystic Manor is one of my favourite rides and can't be found anywhere else!)All in all, we had a spectacular time at Hong Kong Disneyland.

398364653,4,2016-7,India,HiWe bought 2 days pass for Disney online which turns out to be cheaper ... Infact you can finish the same in 3 4th of a day if you reach there by 10 in the morning Its comparitive very small as compared to others . The rides   games are all as per walt disney standards . Try going on the week days if you want to avoid the queues .. Only thing which is upsetting is that even a bottle of water is 28 HKD which quite upsetting ... One knows any ways that when kids are there they dont understand what money means and thats where people earn Money ..,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"398301708,4,2016-7,Malaysia,""Compared to my last visit in Nov 2008 which I enjoyed very much, this time was a bit different.Perhaps it was due to the weather and because of summer holidays, there were too many visitors, especially the rude and cutting queue ones. Suggestions so that your visit will be better:  avoid the summer crowd  bring strollers or else, you can rent at the site  bring umbrella just in case it rains or for you to hide from the summer heat  bring water bottles  you can refill at the water coolers. water cost a bomb there  food drinks carts are everywhere, halal restaurant is available so you can be there the whole day. Perhaps snacks are allowed to be brought inside during the bag inspection, the officer told us that rice was not allowed  so we ate our rice just at a rest area, then went in.  if you want to take your time, please get the 2 day pass  stay at the disney hotel if you can or stay anywhere in lantau island that is close to the MRT station that has trains to Disneyland. It's convenient.  stay for the fireworks.  if you do stay for the fireworks, then the crowd going back will be really huge!

This place really will give you the chance to bond with your kids as you go along with and enjoy the rides.

397953748,4,2016-2,Philippines,I'm back to visit disney this time with my youngest son and daughter. Our last visit here was 5 years ago with my eldest daughter. I can say that after that I was really happy to see the added attractions like the Toy story and Grizzly bear. Plus the shows were superb specially the Lion King. We enjoyed our visit like it was just our first time. Plus the fact it was a perfect timing on a weekday we were there Wed a lot of people but not crowded and the lines in the rides was fast fast. We even get to enjoy Space mountain riding on it 3 times in a row since there were no lines during that time. We enjoyed the weather also because it was winter :) We just got disappointed having our pictures taken with some of the mascot because of the long line and sometimes they cut the lines and we still have to chase them on their next schedule for photo sessions. But over all we will be glad to come back again. All the roller coaster rides was fantastic Grizzly bear and space mountain is our favorite.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"397920737,4,2016-3,Malaysia,""Disclaimers: We're a vegetarian family, and we're not  into  merchandised goods of movie   cartoon franchises! We browsed through the website and made an effort to find out start timings and durations of the shows in advance, figured the most popular rides, and planned a  route  to walk less, and enjoy the most!We spent 2 memorable days in HK Disneyland, including a 1 night stay at the Disney Hollywood Hotel. The resort is well connected by road and MTR. Since we had booked our tickets online in advance, we did not have to stand in the queue for long. This might also be because we planned to be there on weekdays, we reached earlier than park opening on both days and of course our little cheat sheet route plan. For us the BEST part about Disneyland were the parades, and shows (including the little side acts!)   My advise would be : dont miss any at all as far as possible, even if it means missing a ride or two. Two days are an overkill and might only be required for HK Disneyland if its crowded   weekend. We managed to complete all shows and all rides in 1.5 days. It turned out to be a lucky plan because the Paint the night parade was cancelled because of rain on Day1. There was an Easter egg hunt theme underway while we were there, and both kids LOVED it as well. All of us had different favorite rides...but we found something to love in each land, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Adventure Land, Toy Story Land, Mystic Point, Fantasy Land.

"397775873,5,2016-7,United States,""By far, the biggest problem visiting Hong Kong Disneyland in July is the oppressive heat.

We have been to all of the Disney parks except the new one in Shanghai, and many of the rides at Hong Kong Disney cannot be found anywhere else. In particular, we really enjoyed Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Car (a combination of Big Thunder Railroad and Expedition Everest) and Mystic Manor. The park does need more fans and cooling mists in the waiting areas but that was our only complaint. We had our lunch and dinner at the indoor Chinese restaurant and we found the food good and the cold a c refreshing. There was no line to get into the restaurant.At only US$70 for an adult admission, we found Hong Kong Disneyland to be a very good value. Next time, we'll probably visit during a colder time, so we'll be expecting bigger crowds but at least we won't have to spend a small fortune on cold drinks."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"397727343,4,2015-8,Philippines,""My experiences in this place are always worth remembering. The first I time I visited with my mom, I haven   t gone through all the attractions. So I vow to visit the place again with friends and family and go through to those I have missed before. It would be worth the time if you will be early so you can visit all the attractions for every area there is queue line and every theater show has a slot time. There is a need to budget the time and the guide map is very helpful. The staffs are very friendly. The Lion King and Golden Mickey are great. Kind of show that kids will surely most love it. The Grizzly Gulch is fun. I love it. It is the most twisting experience there ever. Where you can shout loud all the way. But what is the most fascinating is the Disney in the stars fireworks. It was breathtaking. Colors sparks above the sleeping beauty castle. Dreams do come true indeed. It is surely one of the happiest places on earth"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"397726017,4,2016-3,Singapore,""It might be smaller than the Disney in US or Paris, but the fun is definitely the same! taking the rides are a breeze since the queue doesn't exceed more than 15mins, even for the popular ones.

"397720792,4,2016-7,Australia,""While my wife and I have waited a good 40 years to go to a Disneyland to see Mickey and the gang, our 9 year old son and 7 year old daughter were at the perfect age to have their first experience.Without another Disney experience to compare it to, I can'y comment on the standards in comparison to other parks in the franchise. Our experience was fantastic and we were not disappointed.We got to the park at 11:00am and stayed until the night parade at 8:30pm and the fireworks finished. we arranged transfers through the hotels tourist guide to make it simple for us on the day.Rides are about a 30   40 minute wait no matter which one you are attempting to ride. The weather is HOT & HUMID, take hats, sun screen and drink lots of water. Tomorrowland is great and the new Star Wars roller coaster which is completely in doors is amazing!!Expect to spend around $1000 if you are going to the hit the shops up, its is hard not to get in to the spirit of it once you are there. There are merchandise shops all over the park, and you have to walk back through the main strip of them on the way out, so don't feel like you need to buy up as soon as your walk in.There is one shop just through the castle doors that does the Mouseketeers Mickey ears and you can have names embroided, this is pretty cool and something unique to take away.Due to the time spent at the park and the heat, it was epic, it was magical and we loved our day so much, we are planning to go to the one in America.Not the biggest, but enough to bring up the memories of growing up for the adults and a truly special place for the kids.

397391316,5,2016-7,Australia,My Grandson who is 11 had a ball with the Jedi training that he participated in. However his 14 year old sister was gutted as she could not do it as she was too old.So much to see and do was quite a good day despite the mopey teenager. Everything is run like clockwork precision from all activities and parades. Not huge lines for rides and get through them fairly quickly.Impressive gardens and grounds. Very hot humid day.

"397387464,4,2016-7,Australia,""This was our second visit in three years and the standard has dropped a little. The rides are still the same but the cafe serves very average food and the gift store no longer sells quality gifts. Very average things for sale and we were disappointed that the more expensive items like ornaments were no longer for sale. You cannot get a decent coffee here. The place is only small so one day is plenty of time. What I did find annoying is they were offering a cheaper deal for people from Asia but any other country, you did not get a discount. In Australia this would be classed as being racist and discriminating against people. I did contact management about this as I did think it was very unfair to give discount to certain people and not others. The kids had a good day here so it is worth the visit. Just dont expect any decent food and long lines to get on a ride. Make sure you stay to the end to see the street parade. Small but cute."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"397260751,5,2016-7,Philippines,""Not the biggest park but still as magical. It's summer so the heat can be unbearable, so to manage we made a lot of pit stops in airconditioned shops, saw the shows which were all airconditioned, and focused on lining up in attractions with airconditioned waiting areas in the morning and afternoon. As soon as the park opened we quickly ran to Space Mountain for the Star Wars ride to get it over with. Good thing we did because there was only a 5 min waiting time and when we finished our ride the waiting time was at 30 mins. Water is HD28, so I suggest to bring a water tumbler or prepare to break the bank. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Overall although enjoyable a little underwhelming .,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
397153726,4,2016-7,Australia,Once again the advice is to go early. We got there before opening time and still had to wait to purchase tickets.

397133507,3,2016-5,India,We visited Hong Kong Disneyland with the kids ages 7 & 9!

"397127993,5,2016-3,United States,""When you think of Disney you think big, crowds, and busy! We visited Hong Kong Disneyland in the off season and I was surprised. We had a fantastic day but there are some things you should know going in. (1) The park is small. Really small. You can realistically do the park in one day. The park is about 1 2 the size of California's Magic Kingdom. For our experience with our toddler, the size of the park was just fine. Due to the size some of the rides that are in other Disneylands are not here but Hong Kong makes up with it by having other lands (i.e. Mystic Manor, Toy Story Land). (2) With the off season you will not have to wait. I think the longest we waited for a ride was about ten minutes which was fantastic. (3) The characters are there! I was really surprised how many character experiences there were throughout the park. (4) Easy shuttle from the hotel. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and we were able to shuffle my son back and forth in the park without any problems. (5) The operation times are different. I was really surprised that in March the park did not open until about 10:30 in the morning. Main Street was open but the rest of the park was not. (6) The prices  it's a Disney experience. Get ready to shell out big Hong Kong Dollars for anything. Its pretty much a once and a lifetime opportunity so live it up and go big or go home. (7) Don't fret if you use a restroom and come across a squatty potty  there are western toilets in there, you just have to look. :)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

397115300,4,2016-6,India,Smallest and youngest in the Disneyland Park Family. Even on weekday   one has to wait for hours and in hot weather   it's a torture. Although map of the park is available for free and in abundance   there is no clear route or path to follow. It's like you are in a maze. You need 2 days to cover it properly with kids considering the Disney parade of day and night both plus fireworks. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"396521742,3,2015-12,Mauritius,""Overall the place is ok. Yet, you need to plan well before going. I suggest you to go early in its opening hours as you will not have to queue up for long for the rides. Around 3pm, you need to wait for around one hour for a 5min ride.Also, if you are a Muslim, know that there is no good dining option and there is no prayer room.

396450640,5,2016-7,United Kingdom,We had a fantastic time at Disneyland Hong Kong. It's what you come to expect from any Disney theme park! The rides are all fun and waiting times for most very manageable. HK Disney is significantly smaller than its Orlando counterpart so comfortably completed in a day without too much rush. The parades in the afternoon and evening were both great. We booked the meal package where you can select to eat lunch and dinner in a range of food courts and a snack from any of the vendors. Maybe saves you a few dollars but not the be all and end all. Tomorrowland and fantasyland both closed at 4:30 for their premium pass holders which is a shame. Why should regular customers miss out when we have paid good money to experience the whole park? The usual rude people that push and shove in queues and parades will get on your nerves but obviously not the park's doing. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"396231068,4,2016-7,India,""Loses a few points due to the tameness of the roller coasters and the fact that getting water here is an absolute pain. The park area is small as compared to its Western counterparts. However, the night belongs to them. A parade in the night which was simply glorious was followed by an epic fireworks display. All the Disney feel and love is abundant. You'll feel absolutely great when each character comes in on their tableaux and on the beautifully lit castle. However, the park needs some upgradation as it feels a little flat in the day."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"396183842,4,2016-6,South Africa,""The resort is easily accessible on the metro   there is a line directly into the resort.

I would actually recommend going at 15:00 during summer. It's everything you would expect from Disneyland. There isn't many adult rides and it's obviously not as great as the U.S. Resorts but definitely still worth it. This was a great day out for us   27 yrs and 34 yrs old and no kids! :) It is a very expensive day out. A small meal is 120HKD. An ice cream is 35HKD and a small bottle of water is 32HKD. The souvenirs for sale are much cheaper though, especially compared to the food! We stayed until the end. We watched the paraded which was amazing and the fireworks show!

"396132205,3,2016-7,Australia,""It has some (by no means all) of the features of Disneyland but it's small and pokey really and disappointing if you've been to any of the US parks, Euro Disney or even Tokyo. To be honest I think this was just Disney marking time until the Shanghai park opened and I wouldn't be surprised to see it close once the bigger version on the mainland takes the tourists.

Nice evening fireworks but nothing spectacular. We did not see all the attractions but my kids and I enjoyed our visit overall.

"395944701,4,2015-9,United States,""Hong Kong Disneyland is different form the other Disney parks in that it's much smaller and less crowded. It basically a mini park if compared to the Florida parks. A few nice rides, such as a parachute ride and it's a small world but you can really see the whole park in one day. Short lines at the rides also makes the park easy to do. The park is at the end of a short subway train ride after changing trains from Hong Kong. It's also a 20 minute tide from the airport. We stayed at the disney hotel so we took the Disney bus to the park. But if you stay in Hong Kong itself it's not hard to get to the park by train. If you have the time I would surely take a train out to the park to enjoy a day at Disney. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Kids will love it. The train goes along the perimeter of the park and has only two stations, north and south. Restaurants are very good and there are plenty of activities for all ages.

"395305651,5,2016-3,United States,""I'm going to tell you how to experience the best of Disneyland HK in under 3 hours. This is assuming you are going yourself or with kids   9yrs old, so I haven't included any baby rides.First of all, understand the value of Rope Drop. Rope Drop means being at the park just before they open to be the first on popular rides. Then, knowing which rides to do earlier on will help you beat the lines and will save you HOURS!Ready?Be at the park 20 mins before open to get your tickets. Park opens 15 mins before official opening time, but they restrict you to the Main Street shops. Have a walk around but get to rope drop at the end of main street 5 mins before official park open. At rope drop, go in this order:1. Space Mountain (x 2 times if you like it)2. Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters3. Winnie the Pooh Adventures 4. Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars (x 2 times if you like it)5. Toy Soldier Parachute Drop6. RC Racer7. Mystic Manor (opens an hour later than other attractions)8. Festival of Lion King show (take note of the show time, think it's around 12 noon. You don't want to miss this. If you are behind schedule move this up the order list)10. Jungle River Cruise11. Tarzan's TreehouseThis should take you approximately 3 hours. After this, it's free & easy. The only thing that sucks about going this early is that the evening street parade which cumulates in a fireworks show is pretty neat but that would mean staying out all day anyway.

"395298046,5,2016-3,Philippines,""Being an amusement park aficionado, I was prepared to discount HK Disneyland as one of the more mediocre and smallish theme parks compared to others across the globe. However, I was pleasantly surprised and enthralled at the unique attractions offered! There are several spots that are beautifully distinctive of their Chinese heritage. The Explorer's Club Restaurant, for instance, looked like a dream and it felt like I was transported back to imperial China while I was eating there. Plus, they offered Hainan chicken which is my favorite! The newly installed Toy Story Land is fantastic, designed to make you feel like one of the toys in the movie, with the huge dominos, bulb lights, and toy crates. The rides here are worth noting as well for their thrill factor.My favorite attraction apart from Space Mountain has to be the Mystic Manor! I won't spoil the surprise, but it is definitely a must ride twice, as it offers a different experience every time!I have to comment as well on the absolutely 100% magical fireworks show at the end of the day, which almost brought me to tears. DON'T SKIP THIS! It is by far the best and most enchanting among the other fireworks display I've seen in all Disney parks (Disneyworld Florida included!), as it features one of a kind pyrotechnics coupled with projected animation on the Cinderella castle, lots of flame effects, all beautifully synchronized to Disney music.

Tickets were around 500 HK dollars which I thought was really great value as we were there from around 1pm until 8pm. Really enjoyed the rides especially Space Mountain. For this we got the Fast Pass which u take a ticket that gives you an alternative time to return and at this time you may only queue for 5 minutes (compared to maybe an hour in normal queue ). Really loved The Lion King stage show also, music was fantastic  was like going to a mini musical.

We were there Monday and Tuesday and the lines were not bad. Longest wait was for Winnie the Pooh however we went back to the park in the evening pre fireworks and walked straight on. Space Mountain is still the best!! Mickey's PhilharMagic was also great for all the family.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
394511796,4,2016-6,United States,It's the smallest of the Disney parks so if you've been to the others it's a little disappointing. I have a 13 year old daughter and there wasn't enough for her age level. Sadly Space Mountain was closed due to renovations. The Hollywood Hotel was lovely. Everything you expect from Disney. If you have never been to a Disney park it's a good introduction. It's also better for young kids. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"394488581,4,2016-5,Philippines,""Yup, it really was hot! And i can say it really made the kids a bit tired and grumpy . But of course since it is Disneyland they made the most of their stay! We enjoyed our trip and the rides. And of course the lion King show, parade of lights and mystic point! Lots of walking involved so be prepared! Kids will always get hungry too. Overall it was still fantastic and will definitely go back again."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
394305225,4,2016-7,United States,Really fun especially the Mystic Manor which is not at any of the other parks we've visited. Only bad surprise was two lands closed at 5 on Fridays all month if July for a private function. It was really hot and humid so bring water and a hat. Food is one area where improvements should be made. Also not as efficient as other Disney parks in line management. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"394152992,5,2016-7,India,""Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest out of all the Disney Parks. However, it was great. It was less crowded, so we could actually do more. The average wait time for a ride was 10 15 minutes, compared to an hour at the other Disney Parks.There was a lot to do. We spent a day there and barely got through the whole park. The park consists of seven parts (Main St. USA, Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, Toy Storyland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland). The most congested area was Fantasyland. All the kids were running around having a blast. This is where the Dumbo ride, Teacup ride, and It's A Small World ride is located. I didn't get a chance to go on the Winnie The Pooh ride, bummer. They have a show called Mickey's Philhar Magic. It's a must see. We ate at the Royal Banquet Hall in this section and the food was good. The combo meals will run you about $20US. It's your standard fare (noodles, curry, sushi, pizza, etc.) The pizza and sushi are shaped as a mouse head. This section is also where you can get your pics taken with Mickey and Minnie.Adventureland is where you can take the Jungle River Cruise. This is also where they have the Festival of the Lion King. It's a scaled down version of the musical, The Lion King. The production was on point. I loved the props and costumes.Main St. USA is where you'll find a ton of shops and eateries. At the end of the night, they host the light parade and the fireworks show. The light parade starts at 7:45pm and the fireworks show starts at 8:30pm. Space Mountain, Orbitron, and Jedi Knight rides can be found at Tomorrowland.The Grizzly Gulch is Wild West themed. There's the Geyser Gulch and the Gold Mine Roller Coaster.Mystic Point has the Mystic Manor ride. Be sure to go on this ride. It's super cool and fun. It has a lot of spooky stuff, but it's not scary. Pay attention to the pictures on the walls. I'll leave it at that and won't ruin it for you.Toy Storyland was my least favorite. It's definitely a spot for kids. It has a kids play area and some rides. My eight year old son liked this section.My favorite thing that I did here all day was see the Mickey's Philhar Magic show. It runs about 10 minutes and it's fabulous. You go into this huge theater and they show this short film on the giant screen. It's of various Disney characters singing their songs. It's in 3D and the theatrics are superb. When the Little Mermaid came on, you could feel light sprinkles of water getting splashed on you. When they redid that food scene from Sleeping Beauty, you could smell the cinnamon apple pie. This production is crazy. Do not miss it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"394019575,5,2015-11,United States,""I spent two half days exploring Hong Kong Disneyland   an afternoon and a morning. The park was not particularly busy and also only offers FastPass at two attractions   Space Mountain and WInnie the Pooh. Neither needed a FastPass to be experienced though   wait times were very manageable.While Hong Kong Disneyland shares the same name as several attractions found at the other Disney Theme Parks, they have variations to them and should not be missed. I liked that Small World actually labeled the rooms so you could follow along with the countries represented. Space Mountain had a smooth track with different experience from the others.Hong Kong has several unique attractions that are among the best Disney has ever produced including Mystic Manor and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Train. These are not to be missed.The castle is probably the least impressive of all the Disney castles, but still gives you a magical feeling nonetheless.The park offers several shows and attractions in multiple languages   be sure to check a times guide. English was not widely spoken, but easy enough to get around and communicate, probably more so than what I experienced in the Tokyo parks.Will definitely return once the park expands a bit more."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"394013547,4,2015-11,India,""Being the third disney land among my places of visit . This one is by far the smallest . The park can be completed in a single day .

"393935942,4,2016-7,United Kingdom,""Disneyland Hong kong is not as good as Orlando but is still worth a visit. Based on the magic Kingdom, this park does not offer as many rides and the castle is very small but some of the attractions in this park are done so much better than its Orlando counterpart. Space mountain has been upgraded to Hyper space mountain here and is just so much more fun as you hear start wars music all around the park. Another ride with a different twist on it is Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars based on thunder mountain, again like Hyper space mountain, simply a lot more fun than its Orlando Counter park. Our only complaint was that Tomorrow Land & fantasy land closed at 4:30 on our first of two visits due to a private event, luckily it didn't effect us as we had a two day pass, but if we had only visited for one day this really would effected us especially after we paid good money to get in."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"393867015,4,2016-7,India,""There are seven themed areas inside the Disney land. (Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, Toy Story Land, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland and Main Street, U.S.A.) make sure as soon as you enter take the fast ticket of Tomorrow Land (one of the theme area) ride. It's free and saves your time standing in queue. As soon as you enter you get little confused where to start from. Go to the information desk and ask them. Take the map and start exploring. There are also amazing live shows and parades throughout the day   just confirm the timings at the information desk. For the best discount at Hong Kong Disneyland restaurants, pre book value meal voucher (not included) gets you one lunch, one dinner and one snack! Make sure you stick around for the fireworks show   Disney in the stars, it's choreographed to Disney themes! It takes place at 9:00 in the evening. Of all the rides we loved the Jungle River cruise in the Adventureland and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars at Grizzly Gulch. If you have a kid who is between 8 to 12, this is a great place. This tour takes a whole day so smaller kids gets tired or worn out after 3 to 4 themed park.

"393722471,4,2015-12,Australia,""This is a great place for some fun. In order to have a perspective of the area, it is advisable to take the train ride around the amusement park and see its attractions from this vantage. In order to maximize ride times, it is good to be early in the day and take on the rides you want first. The queue on these can be long from noon time. It is not good to hook up on the free wifi though as my email account had been highjacked with my friends eventually getting rubbish mail soon after."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Very good and worthwhile.Different:There is a different haunted mansion. We only made it 3 4 of the way through before the ride broke down, with us on it, but it was very fun what we saw.There is a different take on the big thunder mountain railroad, and that was a great ride.The same:They have a buzz lightyear astro blasters, which was quite fun.Whats missing:Quite a few rides. eg: no splash mountain, no pirates of the carribean, no roger rabbit, none of the classic car rides (eg: mr toad, peter pans flight, alice in wonderland).Still worth spending a day though!

It was too hard to line up with a 3 and 7 year old in the heat (which was 32 degrees celcius, but felt like 42c according to the app). The sprinkler system's which are at every amusement park in America, should definitely be introduced here, as we ended up missing out on a lot of rides, as the wait was too long.The parade was great   but really that was the only thing that made it feel really 'Disney'."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are lots of gems to discover at Kong Kong Disneyland   including the parades, stage shows, shopping, characters and rides. The lines are longer in some places than others (e.g. Toy Story Land), but most move rather smoothly. We visited in the heat and were grateful for the extra accommodations that Disney took to make the visit as enjoyable as it could be in the humidity. There were fans, lots of drinks available and air conditioning to indoor spaces. If you are travelling with younger children who are not used to the heat   I would suggest going at an alternate time throughout the year.The train access is smooth and the park is very tidy. Main Street is beautifully adorned and the castle is a true Disney gem.So yes! It is smaller. But big deal! If this is your Disney taste   then go for it!

393155721,3,2016-7,Australia,I'm not a Disney fan but I am a good boyfriend so it was with reservation I visited Hong Kong Disneyland. So for those in a similar predicament to me I can tell you it's not all bad. It's easy to reach via the MTR and compared to other theme parks the lines and entry isn't too bad. We managed to fit in about 5 or 6 rides in about 5 hours of a visit. The more popular rides expect a wait of up to 50 minutes or more. You can buy an express pass though and that allows you faster access to rides. The Disney classic rides were very popular but we found the old western area pretty quiet and the rollercoaster there up with the better rides in the park. All in all though one for kids and if you are not a mad Disney fan avoid or wait until you get to Anaheim.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"393147223,4,2016-6,Singapore,""Was a rainy day when we reached. At first it felt wet and cold. As soon as the sky started to clear, it became more enjoyable. Particularly enjoyed the roller coaster ride that are near the manmade geysers. It didn't seem exciting at first until it suddenly moved backwards at top speed and then dash forward. It really set the adrenaline pumping. As it was towards the end of the day where the queues are dwindling, we had the opportunity to have a second ride.The Mystic Manor is another surprise. A combination of special effects combined with ride, I must say is one of the better rides I had taken in recent years. Satisfaction is comparable to the Harry Porter ride that I had tried in Islands of Adventure in Orlando. A good way to spend a day with the little ones.

"392779994,4,2016-7,United Kingdom,""HK Disneyland was very good, but the only problem was the weather as it me and my sister went in the late morning afternoon time so it was very sunny. Therefore, walking around in the sun and the humid weather was very difficult so we kept walking into the shops because the air conditioning was lovely haha. As a result of the weather, I would have went later on in the day around 3 or later because the firework and light display wasn't on till 9, which was the main reason we went to Disneyland. However, the rides, activities and shows there would be perfect for families with young children. However, I think that Hong Kong is not much of a holiday for families with very young children as it is very busy and the streets are quite narrow. The most efficient way to get around HK is by the MTR train stations which is basically like a metro station, which is always busy and would be difficult for young children. Therefore, i would recommend staying in the disneyland hotel or staying in a hotel that is close to attractions that are easily accessible for children.

To maximise the number of attraction you can visit, take the left turn into Adventureland after main street and finish off Grizzly and Mystic Manor early as most of the crowd rushes to Disney Castle or Tomorrowland.To maximise the parade, sit at the roundabout at the end of main street, directly facing the castle.

It is open space, little shade and gets very hot. Also grab water and food for your little ones, there is only KFC around and some Chinese restaurants with overpriced food. At least you can have KFC, but kids can eat something better. (At the entrance gate mention that the food is for kids). If you are interested in a show (you can find out the time from the brochure) better be at the spot 30 min before it starts. People will gather at the main road where the show passes and if you are late , won't see anything. Also better to pass through all the picture stations first and take pictures with all Disney characters before lunch as they all leave for a show and have a long break after.

"391716786,5,2016-7,Australia,""Hong Kong Disneyland is 10 years old   but maintains that Disney timelessness about it. Although smaller than other Disney parks, it loses none of its magic and ability to entertain kids of all ages.You know you are in for a treat when the train arrives complete with Mickey shaped windows, Disney character sculptures inside each carriage, and the friendly welcome messages. Once through the familiar ticket booths, you are met by the regular sights of Main Street. Crowds were light when we visited   and a few of the Main Street shops were not open (not sure if they ever do open). There is a lot of covered areas due to the heat of summer, and plenty of places to sit and recharge before the visiting the next attraction.Some familiar rides, and some new ones   space obviously dictates what can be replicated. Sleeping Beauty's castle, Its a Small World, the tea cups, River Cruise were all great.And of course the parades and shows were excellentOverall a fun day   worth visiting another Disneyland"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"391101386,4,2016-7,Canada,""On a recent trip to Hong Kong we decided to spend the afternoon here. We arrived at 4:30pm and entered the park just as the school groups were leaving for the day. The park was not busy at all. A 3 out of 10 at best. The wait times for Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, Mystic Manor, Hyperspace Mountain and Buzzlightyear were all less than 15 minutes long. The crowds came out for the Disney Paint the Night Parade. It was especially busy by the Plaza Inn, but we moved down to Main Street and found less crowds and a better view of the floats.We made the mistake of purchasing a chicken and pineapple pizza and hot dogs from the Main Street Corner Cafe. They had obviously been sitting under the warming lights for too long and were served as is   which was slightly warmer than room temperature. They were both inedible. We opted for some caramel corn instead   not particularly healthy, but delicious!For those interested in 10th anniversary pins, they are located behind the cash in the Emporium. The lines became very long after the parade and I was surprised that no additional registers were opened at this time. Shoppers would be wise to plan ahead and make their purchases prior to the parade.All in all, Disney fans will enjoy their time at this park. We found Mystic Manor especially charming and loved th creativity of Toy Story Land."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"391013041,5,2016-6,Indonesia,""We went there end of June '16 and it was really hot summer in Hongkong. Prepare for sunscreen cream, sunglass, umbrella, handy fan before going to the park in summer. I would think you will need 2 days to explore the entire park. If only visiting for one day be sure to plan your time wisely so you can get the most of attraction, especially those outdoor parade shows and some indoor shows and be there at least 15mins earlier to beat the queue. If you want to take dinner inside the park, best to have it before the night parade begins otherwise you will be struggling to get the seat in restaurant or worst no more meal left. We were having fun and fireworks show at night 8.45PM definitely a show that you wouldn't want to miss out to end your journey in Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"391012319,5,2016-7,Hong Kong,""Typical Disney  a theme park that could not disappoint. It has sufficient facilities for the young and the young at heart, and rides for the brave and daring. It is a three language park   Cantonese, Putonghua and English. The Park is very close to the town centre, only about 30 minutes from town centre by rail. It is usually described as a relatively small park, but to be fair, it would still take (at least) two days to cover the place. After all, you would not spend the whole day (from 10 am to 9 pm) playing. You need to spend time to lunch, to dine and above all, to queue. By the way, the fireworks at 9.00 pm is awesome. The above said, probably because of the competition from the recently open Shanghai Disneyland, the place, compared with previous years, was obviously less crowded. The average queuing time was only about 20 minutes. The food and drinks are, be aware, very pricey. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
390976798,2,2016-6,Australia,We were disappointed in our visit here. With children over 11 being Adult prices it was an expesive day.....particularly the food and drink prices. We were there during extreme heat so didn't get to see everything because it was just too hot. Waiting in ques for rides was so hot   no relief from the heat. (Unlike the Gold Coast theme parks in Australia where there is water mist and fans to cool you) Our 13 and 15 year olds were simply too old for this place and we would have been better off sightseeing elsewhere and saving ourselves a stack of $.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"390942376,3,2016-7,Malaysia,""We bought the tickets from a local travel agency as it's slightly cheaper than buying the tickets on the spot or online. My husband did some homework before visiting HK Disneyland by charting down which rides or shows which we would like to see and experience. Hence, we didn't missed anyone of them. We would recommend you not to miss the Mystic Manor, Mickey and the Wondrous Book, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Hyperspace Mountain. Be careful when entering the park at 1030am as we experienced some hysterical kids running in to the park and a kid almost made my husband's camera fell to the ground. Another foreign visitor told me that the kids accidentally scratched her arms when they were running frantically into the park once it's opened.The firework display at 9pm was spectacular! Not to be missed. But do prepare that it's gonna be a big crowd going back together at the same time after the firework display."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"390617015,5,2016-7,Hong Kong,""We've been living in Hong Kong for 9 years, and finally decided to venture to Disneyland whilst family were in HK visiting. We pre booked and pre paid for tickets for a specific day";" that day the weather was awful with thunder, lightening, etc. We decided not to waste the money paid and braved the heavy rain.It was the best decision because a normally crowded attraction wasn't crowded, and given all rides were closed, we watched The Lion King show, which was absolutely brilliant, and got our monies worth just from that one show!After the show, the rain subsided, and rides gradually opened. We had a fantastic day.Most of it is outdoors, therefore hot days or heavy rain days probably aren't so enjoyable, unless striking it lucky like us. But the stage shows are brilliant, and the shows alone will make the trip enjoyable (the shows are indoors).There are plenty of choices to eat, or you can take your own food and drink. We will definitely visit again."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;

Could not really enjoy anything. Except for the princess show which was in the auditorium, I didn't really like anything over there. It's not worth the price we have to pay.

"390283824,4,2016-7,Australia,""I've been to a few Disney attractions in my day including Tokyo Disney. Compared to other Disney place it's OK but not amazing. It wasn't as busy as Tokyo Disney (I went on a Thursday in July, would probably be busier on a weekend) so I got to go on all the major rides I wanted, first thing in the morning and returning about 7:30 for the night parade and a last few rides. Yes you have to be careful with the timing, it's busiest in the afternoon. If you go when it first opens (10am for 'main street' shopping, 10:30 for the first rides) most of the minor rides have little or no lines. Use the fastpass for Space Mountain or Pooh.If you go in summer, the heat is PUNISHING. There is nowhere to sit and rest in the air conditioning   you're either sitting in the heat (even in the shade it's hot), or standing in the air conditioning (e.g. shopping or once the lines get inside the buildings). There is some indoor dining but of course they're the expensive restaurants. The indoor shows were about the only chance to rest, sitting, inside. So anyway come prepared for the heat   plenty of water, loose clothing, sunscreen, many people use umbrellas for shade. BIGGEST TIP for the heat: buy one of those small handheld electric fans you can pick up at the touristy areas BEFORE going to Disneyland. Inside you can only buy a huge, heavy, expensive Disney fan.All that being said, I still had a good time. I'm glad I went to my hotel for a rest in the afternoon (get your hand stamped and save your ticket to return), then came back for the evening parade and a little bit of fireworks (left before it ended to avoid the crowd going home), even managed to sneak in two more rides right at the end (although many rides close early).Highlight for me was getting a photo with Chewbacca! Yes you have to queue to get a photo but it was worth it. I love roller coasters so my favourite hands down was Space Mountain (Star Wars themed) and the runaway mine car was also super fun."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"390054876,5,2016-6,Australia,""We are fortunate to have been to a few Disney parks, some numerous times. We were aware that HK Disney is often seen as a 2nd rate alternative to the other Disneylands but we went anyway as my dd says  it's still Disneyland . We are all glad we did   we had a great Disney experience that while familiar was different to the other parks (as it should be)We planned our visit carefully using Klook to buy our tickets, avoid the line and save some $. Was easy   they scanned my phone for entry. We also picked the day and time to try to avoid some of the crowds. We arrived on a Tuesday just before opening time. We approached fFantasyland from Main Street just as the park opened. Straight to Winnie the Pooh to beat the crowds. Next we went straight to Space Mountain which worked really well with the Star Wars theme. Short wait (15 minutes) . These are the only rides with Fast Pass so we grabbed one for SM and got something to eat. It was hot and humid so we decided to focus on larger rides (inside) and those that were new to us (toy story land) rather than exposed ones like Dumbo. This probably won't work if you have little kids but it worked for us.The other thing that helped was not waiting to see characters   again this probably won't work if you have younger ones but it did help us minimise time in lines in the heat.We loved RC Racers in Toy Story Land and the Mystic Manor. The LionKing Show was enjoyable and had enough Disney flare. We noticed the Disney characters in its a small world and agree with those that have said they aren't necessary and actually take something away from the ride.The crowds arrived after lunch but were still smaller than I originally feared. The food was good   a nice mix of Asian and western choices. A fun, family day out full of familiar and new things. A shorter day than in CA or FL but that is ok."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is not cheap, but comparative to Universal in Singapore, it's not expensive either. A range of activities for the tiny ones, to those just young of heart.

"389962854,3,2016-4,Hong Kong,""It's Disneyland right so it should be fun! Well it's not that they don't know what their doing its just not quite happening here but things will change soon. For the high price of admission, the park isn't up to standards meaning it's small compared to the others. Combined with overcrowding, long lines for the kids rides and lack of shade in the sweltering heat here equals no fun and probably the main reason they are losing money. Charging the same entrance fee as other Disneylands double the size with twice as much to do also makes no sense. Looks like lots of construction is going on so hopefully in a few years I'll be back to see what has improved."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"389554538,3,2016-7,Australia,""Hong Kong Disney Land if you have never been to another is fantastic! If you have been in America you will most likely be very disappointed as it is small and hot.For kids upto 15 it can be fun as they relive the adventures of Mickey and Minne, ride and sing It's a Small World Afterall and enjoy hanging out together. I seriously advise checking the weather forecast for the evening as we waited in the best spot  in front of the castle and circular garden  for the night parade for 2 hours only to be told it was cancelled, then they did not move the time of the fireworks earlier, so rather than wait for a total of 5 hours we left at 2000. So check with staff that it going ahead or be prepared to miss it. I really recommend visiting the animation studio where they teach you to draw Disney Characters really easily in air conditioned comfort. Please note the train does not do a full circle tour, even though it announces that it does you have to get off and then line up again at halfway, disappointing when you just want to rest and have a breeze!!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Having all kids under 5 we planned our way only aiming to go where the kids were big enough to ride. If you want to avoid crowds try doing it backwards so go against the traffic ie instead of going left go right. Also bring snacks and drinks which you might have to hide in your bag. The parade happens every Night so it's a good idea to check times and go maybe 20'mins before it starts so you get a good view as the good spots get crowded very quickly.

Nice if its not raining, just get ready with umbrella that you can buy in the shop. Had lovely day here and shop a lot, too many interesting stuff. HongKong Disneyland is less big than LA Disneyland but it is still exciting too. The ticket is available online and at entrance whether one time visit or seasonal which is cheaper then one visit. Very recommended place to visit in HongKong! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

From the story time pyjamas night in the hotel's kids club to the fantastic range of activities in the park itself, my kids were dying to come back to this magical place every time we come to Hong Kong.

"388808780,3,2016-6,South Africa,""Visited the park with my family and found that it was not value for money, staff friendliness was very poor, communication in English was a challenge, not enough English maps, choice of food and beverage was poor and not all accepted credit cards and it was quite small compared to any other Disneyland Park anywhere in the world. Good attractions included Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars, Jungle River Cruise, Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh, Mickeys PhilharMagic and Hyperspace Mountain. There was a mid afternoon parade which was poorly advertised. Lots of shops. I would not go to this attraction if you have visited the ones in Orlando and Los Angeles.

"388446489,5,2016-5,Philippines,""We were in Hong Kong Disneyland for four consecutive days. My niece was happy because it was her first time to go there. On the first day, it wasn't so great because one of the staff who stays alongside Chip and Dale shouted at my 9 year old niece, who burst into tears when we were on our way to City Hall (guest relations & information) to report the incident. After reporting the incident, the staff told us that they would immediately investigate and take action. They gave my niece some small tokens and fast passes to some rides. When the day is halfway done, my niece felt happier. Overall, there were no more bad incidents for the rest of our visit and most of the staff were nice and friendly. We were able to enjoy most of the rides because it was raining for two consecutive days in the afternoons and people were hiding inside the stores (rain doesn't bother us much)."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"387946361,4,2016-5,United Kingdom,""This is probably the smallest of all the Disney Parks. Not that I have done them all, my tally is only 4 so far. Hong Kong, Paris, LA and Orlando.Had I not known it had been there for a decade I'd have sworn it was just opened and would eventually become much bigger.None of this was helped by most of Tomorrowland being closed off to allow for the Star Wars experience.The Disney Railroad was a train around the park and nothing else.The Castle felt tiny.Having been to all the western parks I was quite surprised by HK Disney's take on Big Thunder Mountain which is by far the best of any version in any western park. The Haunted Mansion alternative was also quite unique and though very clever I struggled to see a particular Disney connection, perhaps it will grown on me.A Small World is just better here, far more Disneyfied with recognisable characters from the movies.Do see the Lion King show, it is worth it for sure.In all, it's an OK park but can probably be done in half a day, a day tops unless it was particularly quiet when we were there because there really were no queues for anything.The train in is a lovely novelty, go that way if you can.

Go for the shows 1st then ask the staff the time for characters photo taking.All staff has stickers which kids would love if you ask politely. Do not bring food as it's not allowed The guards will check your bags. Water tumbler is ok. There are water refill stations every where. Bring an umbrella or wear a cap as it's very hot.

"387558771,3,2016-4,Hong Kong,""My friends and I (nine of us in total) decided to visit Disneyland during our Easter break. We booked tickets beforehand, from a website that sold it cheaper, plus the meal voucher that included one meal from any restaurant in the theme park. Originally, we had been informed by a misleading website that the $100 meal voucher included both lunch and dinner, plus a snack from the vending carts (which was an extremely good deal, which was why we got the voucher in the first place). But when we got there, we were told that the $100 voucher only included one meal of your choice which was very disappointing and overly priced. I ate a bowl of Japanese styled noodles and had a drink, which were both fortunately quite delicious.As teens, we did not spend time taking photos with Mickey or any of the Disney characters. Instead, we immediately jumped into playing some of the games, including Space Mountain (my personal favorite, although it made me a little dizzy)"; a game called Grizzly something, I forgot (it was a very creative roller coaster, it even went backwards!); a target hitting game (we sat in moving carts and aimed at targets with a plastic gun);" and a ghost house (we sat in moving carts and was guided through a haunted house with scary objects popping out at us). We loved Space Mountain and the Grizzly game, which we played more than five times each. There were many many other games that are more suitable for younger children, but since we only enjoyed more exciting   stimulating games, we didnt bother with the other games that were intended for younger children.As we had got to Disneyland quite early (right after it opened), there wasn't that much people at first and we were able to get to most of the games we wanted to play without having to line up. However, after lunch time, the lines grew increasingly longer and we started having to wait more than half a hour for each game. We left after one last ride of Space Mountain, at around 7 or 8. We had heard that the fireworks were worth watching, but since one of my friends was expected to return home at a certain time, we didnt stay to watch the fireworks.Luckily the weather was quite nice the entire day and we enjoyed all of the games we played. If you enjoy more exciting rides (roller coasters etc.), I would suggest you go to Ocean Park instead of Disneyland. Ocean park has much more rides that are more fun to go on (if you're older than 12 and not afraid of heights). From what I experienced, I would say that Disneyland is intended for younger children. anyone from under 11 years old would experience the most fun here.Have fun :)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;

"387212226,4,2016-6,Singapore,""We signed up 'Three Magical Days' Disney Getaway Deluxe Package and stayed two nights at Disney Hollywood Hotel. The sea view room was decorated in Star Wars theme which we got a huge BB 8 plush toy. Kids got really excited when they saw it sitting in the middle of our bed. They willingly carry it home themselves, if not , luggage space to fit it in would have a big issue. We too got 8 pieces of lovely Star War themed cookies as well as slippers in the room upon arrival. The high summer temperatures really exhausted everyone. By 3pm,two preschooler kids got grumpy and luckily we got to recharge everyone energy with a short nap in hotel. The Disney's Paint The Night' parade at 8pm is really a not to be missed great LED light parade.Park meal coupons were good as the food in Disneyland is expensive. A HK style milk tea cost HKD16 on the street. It costs HKD23 in the famous TsuiWah restaurant chain but it costs HKD30 in Disneyland.During our visit, unfortunately, three restaurants out of the seven restaurants where we can utilized the coupon were not opened. The closure during this summer peak period did puzzled us. We enjoyed Explorer's Club restaurant in Mystic Point given there was almost no queue there during dinner time. Most visitors crowded at Royal Banquet Hall in Fantasyland. There was only four set meals available in Starliner Diner which quality of food were less than satisfactory. Our package gave us only 3 sets of voucher for each meal but the food portion were more than enough for four of us. My kids attended Jedi training in Tomorrowland. Kids learned how to wield lightsaber and fight Darth Vader on stage. The kids training were seamlessly weaved into the stage story which parent got to enjoy the stage performance and see our kids involved in it. Great jobs! Our package gave us two PhotoPass Plus which we never got to utilized. First, the park was crowded and the queue was long at the PhotoPass Plus selected picture spots. Second, we only allowed to use it in the park but not in the hotel. Third, unlike other theme park we went where there is a lot of photographers offer to take our photo at various spot but not in Disneyland. Despite the fact that we were given reserved viewing area during Parade and fireworks, we didn't get to use it as the area are too small to fit the numbers of users. In future, I will still bring my kids back to Disneyland. The stage shows Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book maintained its utmost quality. We had almost no complain, we saw subtitles in English or Chinese on the digital screen which is useful. Of all, kids love the colorful Toy Story Land. Fairytale forest is best to be visited just before it close at 730 pm when it is dark. The forest exudes its magic the most under the evening light.We made a Bibbidi Bobbidi appointment on the first day of our visit. Luckily, they could fit us into the schedule on our check out day. I was surprise to find out that I have to prepare my own outfit for my kids if we to sign up the Crown Package which cost HKD1000 less. At the end, we bought the costume at the Disney Shop at HKD498. The price is still much expensive than the retail price outside Disneyland. The purchase of the costume gave us a 20% discount for the Crown Package or 30% discount for the Castle Package. It is peak summer holiday now in HK. We still managed to go for quite a number of rides under the summer heat and when the crowds were probably at its peak. Of course,we forgo some rides given my kids are still too small to enjoy roller coaster ride at Grizzly Gulch. Nonetheless, the queuing time mostly around 20 mins as park facilitates are build to cater to huge crowd. A carousel for example can take up to 60 people in one go. We utilized the fast pass which also shorthen the queuing time. Planning a trip with relax pace for young kids is the key to make any trip enjoyable. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Plenty of laughter and fun throughout the day. Maybe it helps that we are huge fans of classic Disney cartoons. The songs and cartoon characters always brings back fond childhood memories.

If we reach there and the it didn't give any sign of rain to stop, we will cancel our day inside the Disneyland....Surprisingly, when we reached there, the rain getting smaller... smaller... and it stopped after a while. The best part for a theme park after heavy rain stop is... yes, I think you guess correctly, it won't be so crowded, as many people are not as crazy as us...

"387065420,5,2016-6,Singapore,""My wife and I, plus our 2 Daughters aged 12 & 5, Just got back from a 2 day trip in sweltering Hong Kong Disneyland. We stayed at the Disney Hollywood Hotel and bought a deal with Breakfast included, at least we thought so, after paying for the trip we found out at breakfast on Day 1 that breakfast was only for 2 adults. Be careful when booking online as this is NOT stated anywhere when booking through the slimy Disneyland Website. On the whole we enjoyed the trip.Pros: Good fun for kids and some enjoyable rides. Buzz Lightyear, Hyperspace Mountain and Runaway Mine Carridges are the best rides along with RC Racing, however be aware queues are horrendous with only one or two rides allowing FastPass. This needs to be addressed by Disney and some kind of pass for less queueing should be introduced. 30 40mins queuing in 37 degree heat is awful...pool at hotel was nice but hot water in pool. There's a great fun slide for kids and adults though at the Hollywood Hotel.Cons: Too many people, not enough cold drinks and water around. Queues too long, and beware there are zero benefits from staying at a disney hotel other than a short queue to get in. In Eurodisney at least there is an exclusive period in morning and evening for extended rides. We were very shocked and disappointed to find out on our first day half the park shut down at 8pm. More like a prison than a theme park. Staff at the hotel were pleasant and very helpful but overall very expensive thus a let down due to timings for attractions and alack of fans etc in the massive queues due to overcrowding. Breakfast and the hotel in general was noisy and overcrowded, had to wait for breakfast both days plus Disney characters in the park were not around for long, or again long queues. Overall 6 10 but could easily have been 10 10 if more Customer satisfaction was given rather than profit seeking. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The live shows were absolutely amazing and worth the wait! I don't think it's necessary to be waiting exactly when they suggest but at least a 10min before the start of the show. *our wait times might be skewed because we went on a Wednesday on a very very hot June day (weather channel said it felt like 105oF the day we went).There are many good food options for people but there was only limited air conditioned seats so we opted to buy hotdogs from a stand and stayed under the shade for a quick bite to eat.

The experience is getting better: my daughter old enough to enjoy the park to the full extend, less crowds (still crowded but much better than before), more rides and more Disney Character encounters.Now they have two parades: one usual one at 3:30pm and one additional night parade (added for their 10th anniversary as I comprehended) at 7:45pm. The Firework showv thus is moved to 8:45pm.The Princesses can often to find at the Pavilions at the right of the castle (we managed to get 5 princesses encounters: just before the study published to discuss how Disney Princesses could harm your girl).The Mickey mouse magic book show and the mystic mansion ride, which we did for first time, was surprisingly good."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"385858386,3,2016-6,United States,""My husband and I love Disney. Every 5 years, we go to Orlando's Disney World for our Anniversary. We knew HK Disneyland couldn't hold a candle to Orlando's but we wanted to go for a cultural comparison. While this park has my favorite ride (Mystic Manor) and favorite roller coaster (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars) out of all of the Disney rides I   ve been on, the rest of the park was lack luster. In the defense of the park, it was raining pretty much all day. (Rain has the potential to put a damper on just about anything.) The parade was understandably cancelled due to the weather. They did end up having the fireworks show at closing. The fireworks dwarfed the castle and it was a little humorous to me that the smoke from the fireworks completely hid the castle by the end. If you are in HK and you love Disney, definitely go for the Disney cultural experience. If you are not a Disney fan, this park will not make you become one."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even better we went midweek and barely had to line up anywhere! We really enjoyed Astro blasters, Its a small world, Mystic Manor, RC racer, Mountain mine cars and the Tea cups. The shows were truely spectacular, we loved the parades but the fireworks can not be missed!!! It was the perfect way to finish the day!

"385677088,4,2016-6,Norway,""The Disneyland amusement park is for more kids than grown ups. If you're going for the roller coasters etc. then I will not recommend this park. The mining roller coaster was great in the way that it had some original tweaks. The inside Star Wars roller coaster was very fast and the scenery was great adding to the feeling of speed.The park gets very hot so remember something to protect your head and sun blockers. SunBlockers was sold out in the park for Weeks it was claimed. Here management needs to react! The fast food is expensive all over the park.

All the staff was phenomenal and we are planning another trip back this month and will be staying in one of the resort hotels. This park had Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Adventure Land and Toy story land. There are also many food choices both eastern and western to choose from.

But if that is the expectation then no disappointment!!! The shows made the day, the festival of lion king, Mickey and the wonderous book, the street parades are magical, Mickey Philhar Magic a 3D movie which is awesome. These theatres gave relief to the heat. Queues for many rides, and we came back to a few when lines shorter. Queues for character photos long and it was just luck sometimes when we got some. I would imagine same at all other Disneylands around the world! Grounds are lovely and clean as are the amenities. Children just would love this once in a lifetime experience.

Moreover, we loved the shows and the parade that featured the Disney characters. I remembered that moment when we had our lunch at the main street corner cafe in which my boyfriend and I hurriedly asked for the bill and went out just to witness the parade. That time we were so excited to see the Disney characters, it will really bring out the child in you. Watching the fireworks is the best way to end your magical visit to Disney, but wait, the experience was a lot memorable when my boyfriend planned to have the proposal during the fireworks display but I was just too tired to walk right in the middle of the main street where he planned to do it, He failed!

But, still you get to feel like you are a kid again.My recent visit in HK is with my fiance and my future in laws. First time for my future in laws so I was a bit worried that they might have a hard time roaming around the park since they're already senior citizens. But, to my surprise, they had a really great time! They enjoyed their visit in Disneyland. They love the shows (Lion King and Disney story book) and the rides (grizzly gulch, its a small world, train...) Too bad space mountain is under maintenance im sure they would like that also. The parades are also a must watch (parade of stars, night parade and fireworks display). Selfie stick is not allowed in the park which I just think is right since sometimes it can be annoying especially when you're watching a show. The weather is really nice, it was warm but not that sunny. It drizzled though but only for a few minutes. The last time I visited Disneyland HK was 2 years ago... I was just surprised that the prices of water and food sky rocketed. Oh well, this is really expected when you visit theme parks. We got the tickets in a discounted rate from our hotel.

If you plan to visit HK Disneyland, be sure you allot the whole day (that includes night   for the fireworks!). A lot to see, and a lot to try!

"384099952,4,2016-6,Philippines,""(Disclaimer: I have a 9 month old son who joined us for this trip.) It is accessible by MTR that makes going to Hong Kong Disneyland quite easy. Step free access everywhere so strolleys and wheel chairs are definitely in. The process of getting a ticket and entering the park is a breeze. Due to its small size, you can actually roam around the park in half a day, so you have to space out the rides properly. Disneyland HK is divided into seven areas, each catering specifically for visitor's needs. Main Street, Fantasyland, Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land offers rides and attractions suitable for children of all ages, while Toy Story Land, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point are for more mature and aged visitors. Each of the rides take just about 2 3 minutes, although the waiting time for some attractions may take 15 to 30 minutes for others, so it is suggested that you plan out your rides to maximize your entry. In some of the rides, it literally ends in a shop. If you are pressed for time, move ahead, as the Main Street offers a long range of shops and all the merchandise are found there.There is a parade of Disney stars at around 7:30 PM and a fireworks display at 8:45 PM. Best vantage point would be in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle, just near the roundabout at Main Street. Once the parade of stars and fireworks end, you have about 30 45 minutes, either to freshen up or do some last minute shopping at the Main Street shops, as they are the last to close. There are also dining areas that remain open up till closing time.While I appreciate the entire Disneyland Hong Kong experience, I do have some points for improvement especially for the fireworks display, which is the cap or finale of the activity. There are a lot of smoke generated by the fireworks display that obscure the view of the spectacular fireworks. Perhaps the management can do something about it.Overall, I felt like a kid again. To see and live and dream, a whole new world once more. Kudos. I shall definitely come back here, once my son is big enough to enjoy the sights and sounds of Mickey's world."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"383346573,3,2016-6,Australia,""I visited Disneyland solo & while it doesn't compare to Anaheim, I still really enjoyed myself, even the rain didn't dampen my spirits! There were a few rides, and the longest I stood in line was 15 minutes. Don't miss Mystic Manor or the Jungle River Cruise. Festival of the Lion King is also one not to miss! You could should probably skip Tarzan's Treehouse as the best thing about it was the 30 second raft ride over there. Sadly, the main parade was cancelled due to the weather, but the Electric Light Parade (goes by a different name in HK) made up for it! It was spectacular! The only down point was being served a Mickey Waffle (which in itself was amazing) by an extremely rude staff member, who really didn't embody the 'Disney Spirit' at all! Other than that, an awesome day out in Hong Kong! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
383328538,5,2016-6,United Kingdom,I have visited many Disney lands over the world and I have now been to the hong kong Disney Land. While this park is smaller. It has a very good feel. The rides here and aimed more for the younger children but the themes you can see while walking around are pretty and clean. The only dissapointment I have about this park is the castle. It is very very small compared to other parks and I just think it would be nice to upgrade this to a castle seen at other parks.

The ticket allows you to visit the park for 2 days with 7 days apart.There are several nice rides such as AC rider, grizzy bear which are good for teenagers..We have the fast pass for Winnie the Pooh in day 1 and Space mountain (closed on the first day we were there) on day 2.. Our strategic is to go early for the popular rides, then we also get the fast pass for space mountain. Winnie is more for small kids!The queue in general was not too Long probably due to hot weather in Jun. Our second day was a rainy day, no queue at outdoor rides.. Bought raincoat from Disney costs HK69 for adult size.. Quality is ok, not those thin type..Dinner on first day near Fantasyland was horrible, got myself a mixed grilled but really tasted horrible, price HKD149. Second time lunch near mystic manor is much better, Daughter has her Vietnamese beef Kway Teow at HKD129 which was nice.Overall we enjoy our trip to Disneyland."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Witnessed the Grand Parade of Disney Characters, Tried every single rides from moderate to extreme, mild and creepiest. It was so much fun! Plus all their staff are very helpful, they are always ready to assist with a smile. (From the ticketing, main entrance...). Restaurants inside the Disney are just too expensive.

That said the parade that they have in the afternoon was spectacular and there has been no expense spared. The best rides are Space Mountain and the RC racer in Toy Story Land.I expected the food to be expensive but $105HK ( which is $21AUD) for 3 Mickey Mouse ice creams is ridiculous. The gifts in the gift stores didn't seem too overly priced. We got the 2 day pass and we went back on the second day in the afternoon thinking it may be quieter   it wasn't. The longest we waited was 30 minutes in a line but most of the wait time was 5 to 10 minutes.

The day of my visit June 11th was actually the first day it opened for public  and thankfully it wasn't crowded at all, took 4 rides and didn't wait for more than 15 minutes! It was a superb experience!)4) Parachute Drop & RC CarsYou have to ride on it to experience the thrilling sensation yourself.. way different if you just see others on it. It's fun!!!There are also other interesting and enjoyable rides such as:1) Jungle River Cruise2) Slinky Ride3) Orbitron, etc.And for everybody else, better wait till late in the evening because at 7.45 pm they will have night parade (along the Mainstreet USA) and as a finale there is a spectacular fireworks at 8.45 pm (best viewed around the Sleeping Beauty Castle).Food was quite pricey, but they serve big enough portion with generous serving of meat, so it was worth it in my opinion.

The park needs to be friendlier and I don't think the locals can do that, time for Disney to look outside of HK to hire friendlier cast members! The shows are amazing so definitely make time for those. We were there from opening to closing and still felt it wasn't enough time, so definitely coming back. It was raining the entire day we were there so perhaps visit sometime during winter or spring cause it gets rainy during the summer anyway.

From the custom Disney Train, to the small art work throughout the park the attention to detail was incredible. This park didn't seem as big as others in Hong Kong (such as Ocean Park) but wow did it impress. Highly recommend going to this park on a weekday being sure that its not during school holidays or a public holiday. We went on a Monday with the weather forecast scheduled for thunderstorms";" we scored lucky and didn't see a drop of rain all day. The end result, an all but empty park until around 1PM when some more locals turned up. Still we didn't wait more than 5 15 minutes in any line. Due to our fortune with the crowds, we managed to see all three of the shows (4D cinema, theatre productions and lion king musical), meet and greet a selection of our fav characters (Goofy, Chewbacca, Micky and some Storm Troopers), watch both parades (lunch time one and evening one followed by fireworks display) and do every ride in the one day (note, we were not traveling with children and spent limited time in the gift store and eating).

We made the decision to arrive early, just before they opened the gates.... and that was the right choice. We were able to visit every attraction ride that we wanted to see without the long lines you get at their counterparts in America....At a price that is about 1 2 as much. The differences in some the attractions were a pleasant surprise to say the least. Space Mountain is a new version and the Jungle Cruise was just amazing fun. The food was also different in a good way as well, not as much as a Carnival type of restaurants.

Breakfast at Enhanced Garden is ok, definitely not worth the cost but it was an enjoyable experience for our 4 year old with the visits by Disney characters.

Exit the station and a long walk of about 100m to the ticketing counter and the entrance. It was a sunny day if you go in June, so remember umbrellas, sun screen and raincoat too.Reached the entrance of the ticketing counter you need to go through the security counters where they will searched your bag. Dried food and water are fine but not other cooked food or drinks. Then ticket counters on both left and right of the main walkway. I bought the ticket online so just go there show your email confirmation and the credit card that you used to purchase the tickets. After that is another long queue to pass through the ticket scanner with plenty of staffs to help.Once in, you can get the map to the Disneyland. We were there before it starts to open, thus the main street was open but not the rest of the land. Basically there are couple of lands available that you can check online.Few things to note, drinkable water can refill outside the washroom but not all. Snacks stall is available at each land. You need to queue for any photo session with your fav disney characters. Most of the shows are in air conditioned enclosed area. Parade is towards the late evening followed by the fireworks.

Sometimes height can be an issue at theme parks but not in Hong Kong!Sunday and Monday were good days to visit, with Monday being busier which surprised us. Queues were in the range of 5mins (walk straight on) to up to an hour for the main rides on Monday. We managed to time visits to minimize wait times. The only downside was the extortionate prices for food and water. Given the captive audience I understand they need to turn a profit but if you can I suggest you bring your own. Options are limited and I'm still in shock at paying the asking prices. If we had been able to keep the family fed and watered at more reasonable rates then Disney HK would have been a solid 5 stars. Everything else was fantastic. The parades and fireworks were spectacular and the Lion King a must see!

"380989673,2,2016-6,Australia,""This is the second Disneyland I have been to after the one in Anaheim. It was my first trip to Hong Kong however and perhaps the review I'm leaving is due to having not experienced the culture here or the people, but it was my experience.The pushing and shoving to get onto each ride was ridiculous. Mothers yanking their screaming children past others to get good seats. I was trodden on multiple times, had my face scratched by umbrellas and selfie sticks (which are prohibited but not policed). On every ride we went on all you could see were the flashes from cameras. On the Mystic Manor ride you couldn't see the projections because everyone was filming it.Aside from the other people there, half of the park was not open. There was a typhoon warning 3 when we arrived and were told none of the outdoor rides would be open at all. Then when we left at 2pm we were told the outdoor rides were about to open (good thing we didn't leave). All the while all of tomorrow land was closed.We ended up going on about 4 rides multiple times as they were our only options, while getting pushed and shoved and blinded by flashes."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"380536076,5,2016-6,India,""Suddenly I was child again, admiring the cartoon characters that I grew up with. I was told this park is smaller. Never the less, it is magical! everything is larger than life. They project positivity and innocence everywhere. This is truly magical experience, Disney brand touches you, elates you, laughs with you, enjoys with you, delights you and packs that extra element of surprise everywhere that automatically draws WOW response. There sure is LION KING show which was simply fantastic The afternoon parade of characters led by Mickey is simply fantastic. The evening Light parade awesome...and night fireworks tops it all. You do not get a second to think..there is punch coming every other second and you are left yearning for more. There sure are rides.. some real some take you to world of fantasy..Parachute Ride is lovely but the star attraction for me was the photo opportunity with your dream characters. Avoid Saturday   sundays.. the park will be crowded and waiting time at rides will be very high. You pay once at entry and then all rides are free.. you can enjoy same ride number of times. Outside food is not allowed. One bottle of water is all you can take inside. There are number of eating options though. One foodcourt was serving 20 national cuisines. Make sure you reach early at 10 and leave only after the last fireworks show at 845 pm. This way you will be able to enjoy the magical experience for a long time "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
380447648,5,2016-4,Australia,Hong Kong Disney is the smallest of the Disney Parks but it is still just as magical. We went in late April and found it to be relatively quiet. Would highly recommend visiting during this period if you can as you could always find a seat at the various eating spots and the longest lines were for Character greetings. Wait times for Space Mountain were 5 minutes all day on both days we visited. Mystic Manor was completely unique and Toy Story Land was cute. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"380313993,5,2016-5,United States,""Hong Kong Disney is more along the lines of Disneyland California as far as size goes. If you're used to Disney Land or Disney World, you will appreciate that that the lines for attractions are almost non existent....at least thats how it was on our beautiful Thursday at the park. Admission is much cheaper than in the states but once you're in....well it's Disney..what do you expect. It has some of the rides you're used too (Small World, Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise) with a few you may have never seen before. The Electric Parade was AMAZING and the fireworks were pretty good too. We were only staying in Hong Kong for the night and realized that our airport hotel was only a few minutes away so we decided why not! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is very different from American or European DisneyParks and is clearly dedicated to the youngest ones here. Pricey too. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"380209381,4,2016-5,Netherlands,""This was the second time we visited this Disney resort. The first time was in 2011 and we thought it was a great relaxing experience. Flash forward to the present and after numerous expansions the park is better than ever, with Mystic Manor being the best ride the world, but there are also more visitors, and mind you these visitors are something to be reckoned with. A nice relaxing trainride around the park becomes a cacophony of screaming people with the cast members constantly asking visitors to stay seated. Watching a parade becomes a daunting experience because people literally stand in front of you or will weasel their way in albeit the parade being almost over. Chinese people don't care for personal space and don't get me started about the visitors from India. Be prepared for people constantly cutting in line because their family is waiting at the front of the line........Park rules forbid these kind of actions but almost everyone makes use of this trick, it is quite frustrating.

380123289,2,2016-6,Australia,There's nothing special. Too expensive. The most popular attractions were closed. It wasn't beautiful the whole park. Better visit Paris or Tokyo Disney. I was disappointed and felt like throwing my money into a garbage bin.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"380102814,4,2016-6,Philippines,""We bought our one day ticket passes at the CTS counters upon arrival at the airport for HKD490 each versus the posted price of HKD539. We scheduled our visit on a Thursday hoping the theme park would not be as crowded. On visit day, there was a huge crowd at the entrance gates. Well, it is Disneyland. Happy and excited faces.Our main objective is the highly rated Mystic Manor at the Mystic Point. We proceeded there following the park map. We were not disappointed. A masterpiece of a ride. We went about the other rides   winnie the pooh, autopia, its a small world and buzz lightyear blasters. The big grizzly mountain runaway mine cars was a blast too. But the best of them all is the Festival of the Lion King show at the Adventureland Theater. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.We liked our continental lunch (Royal Banquet Hall), snacks (Starliner Diner) and Asian dinner (Explorer's Club Restaurant). Price range of about HKD100   150 per meal   per head gives you a full and hefty meal to last the entire day.Parades and other shows throughout the day. Efficient and fast moving lines at every ride. We took the Mystic Manor a second time at night. I could just imagine the crowd volume on weekends & holidays. The only drawback was the intense heat during our visit but I wonder how it would be like when it is raining.The finale was of course the fireworks at the Sleeping Beauty castle at 8:45 pm. People flocked to the Main Street USA leading to the castle for a better view. Whether you are near or far, the fireworks display is amazing. Brings back the child in you.Expect heavy volume of crowd at the close of the park towards the exit gates. We stayed at the nearby Disney's Hollywood Hotel and took the shuttle going back. It saved us time and hassle of taking the mtr or taxi. We were spent and dead tired at the end but was all worth it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

379914246,4,2016-5,Philippines,Rides are just typical Disney rides but not as exciting as those in Disney LA Florida. Food selections inside Disney Hong Kong are a bit pricey though they allow visitors to bring in food and water beverage. The  Mickey and His Wondrous Book Show  is very nice and worth the long queue.

If you reach early just as it opens and plan your trip on a weekday, you can see the entire park and do all the rides in one day, with time to spare. We actually had time to sit and laze around with a cup of coffee while our daughter jumped around. The food options are pretty limited and expensive, so better to carry your own soft drinks. They cost about 30 HKD in the park. Staff is courteous, as expected from a Disneyland, rides are safe and nice. But it's much smaller than the USA ones and that was a disappointment.

"379792906,5,2016-1,United States,""I've been to every Disney resort there is and this one is definitely the smallest and least visited but I have no idea why. Shanghai Disney has not opened yet and amusement parks are such huge attractions in Asia. It felt like Disneyland in Anaheim (my favorite Disney park) placed on an exotic island since behind Sleeping Beauty Castle there are mountains and the ocean is not far. Not as many rides as the other Disney parks and it is only one park, but nonetheless it is still a magical time. Lines are very short since attendance is not that high, the hotels are beautiful, and it gives you that Disney feel and you almost forget that you are in Hong Kong, for a second I thought I was in Anaheim.

We visited Paris Disneyland in 2015 and it was tired, dirty and quite rundown and a big disappointment having been to California and Florida Disney.Hong Kong have done a great job. Very clean, a few different variations of favourites like Mystic Manor have been overhauled and are v good.Overall a great day with the highlight being the night parade, extraordinary, brilliant, exciting, colourful etc!Also, a big plus....

379382923,4,2016-6,Malaysia,We took the MTR(underground) from Hong Kong island and the journey was under 45 minutes. Our family arrived at Disneyland at 10am which was half an hour before the park opened. The queue for the tickets was short and we got our tickets in 5 minutes. You should consider buying your tickets online before you arrive in Hong Kong as some cheaper family packages could only be purchased online outside Hong Kong. It was a hot day but the kids enjoyed the rides very much. Most of the queues for the ride were only 5 to 10 minutes. The longest queue was only 15 minutes! We have been to this theme park many times and this was the shortest waiting times in our experience. I wonder whether this was due to the impending opening of the largest Disneyland theme park in Shanghai. The night parade and the firework display was excellent. The shows were in English with Chinese subtitles. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For me it is better to go during weekdays than weekends. Mystic Manor, Mickey's Wondrous Book, Mickey's Philharmonic, It's a Small World are a must for young and old. RC Racer, Space Mountain, and the roller coaster at the Grizzly should not be missed by thrill seekers."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"379262733,5,2016-5,Australia,""If you are expecting something as large as the Disneyland in California, you might be disappointed but if you are looking to have a great day out, this is the place to go. We travelled in May and there were no queues to get into the park and the maximum wait for any ride (the railway) was about 20 minutes. Most other rides and attractions such as the Lion King show you could just walk in without waiting or with only a 5 minute wait which was great. On some rides we came out and went straight back in again. Some of the rides in Tomorrowland were closed because they are making a Star Wars attraction I think. We got a taxi to the park from Kowloon and it was about a 20 minute drive. We originally thought we would get the MRT back to Kowloon but there was no queue at all for the taxi so again this was our choice. This was surprising as we expected it to be very crowded with everyone leaving the park at the same time. Eating options in Disneyland were limited because some of the restaurants were closed due as it is the low season but there were still plenty of options. We ate lunch at a restaurant next to Mystic Manor and had dinner at a restaurant at the end of Main Street. Make sure you stay for the parade in the evening as it was magical and the fireworks after it were wonderful. We had a great day   even without any kids."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

379084923,5,2016-5,India,We went to HKG because of Disneyworld and it was all worth it.Its necessary to take the 2 day pass to complete all the rides as well as to see all the shows and the parades. Do not miss out the parades and the evening fireworks. Do schedule your movement around the park by taking into account the waiting time required for the shows. Also do check in advance which rides are under maintenance by looking at teh pamphlets given so that one can save time. And do carry an umbrella or cap to protect from sun and be ready to walk a lot,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
379028919,4,2016-5,Singapore,Probably the smallest disneyland in the world.It is good enough for small children. If you have bigger children in seek for a greater adrenaline rush then you would probably be better off at ocean park. Disneyland caters more towards families and are more small children friendly with their rides. Their highlights would be the Lion King and Storybook shows. The night parade and fireworks displays are both highly worth waiting for.The only reason why you may take more then a day to complete the park would be the length of the queue during peak periods.There is a good variety of food and restaurants available. Not much shelter if it rains though.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"378981338,5,2016-1,India,""I visited HK Disneyland with my family in January 2016. We visited here right after we visited Ocean Park in Hong Kong. We had not planned for the visit but we took a cab there from our hotel in Kowloon (the fare was approximately 200 HKD as I remember) and bought tickets there that morning. There is also an option to take the metro there but we did not use this facility. There was a little bit of rain and it was very overcast so we were apprehensive initially, but it didn't rain too much and we had a lot of fun! There wasn't too much of a crowd on the day (perhaps due to the weather), which made it all the more fun. In comparison with Ocean Park, Disneyland is much smaller and doesn't have as many 'grown up' or thrilling rides, but has its own special charm. The food here was great   we had the caramel popcorn and other snacks from the carts and for lunch we had the Indian meals at the Tahitian Terrace. The staff throughout the park are very friendly and extremely professional. My favorite rides were the Runaway Mine Cars in the Grizzly Gulch, the RC Racer and Space Mountain. There is currency exchange facility available at guest services by the entrance in case you need some cash as there are places where you may need to spend cash (eg. the food carts). You can take advantage of the Fastpass facility at certain rides in case of long queues.Overall we had a great day here!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It wasn't busy so I didn't wait more than 10 minutes for any ride. I actually rode RC Racer twice. I like that it had some rides that were universal to other parks like Space Mountain and Its a Small World.

"378489315,5,2016-5,Singapore,""There will always be naysayers in everything, so not everyone will agree with me. But to me Disneyland is the happiest place on earth... Period. I am lucky enough to have gone to the Disneyland Anaheim, and made a promise that when I have kids of my own, I will bring them to Disneyland. This trip, I fulfilled that promise, with my 4 year old. Its not the only Disneyland that I will go to, it will not be the last time I will be at any Disneyland. The magic of Disneyland is very alluring. Its clean, and everyone is having fun! Even in searing heat and scorching sun, parents and kids queue for rides, or to take photos with the favorite princesses or characters, and Mickey Mouse. And this journey starts the moment you enter the Disney train. The whole experience is just something you can explain with words. Yes, the place isnt the cheapest place to have fun. I suppose fun does come at a price. But to me, what makes it all worth while, was those smiles and laughter, those instance of pure bliss and genuine happiness on your child's face. Those are just priceless. For anyone who has kids, or want to be a kid for a day, and you are in HK, you just have to go there. Make it 2 days!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"378478765,4,2016-5,Australia,""This disneyland is much smaller than those in the US, but the weather is often great (warm) and the crowds are much smaller. We went during the week, and as soon as it opens (10am i think)   can definately recommend. We went on the bigger rides a number of times with no waits at all. The extra time that we had because of no queues allowed us to visit some things we wouldnt have usually   the 4d show and another performance   and we ended up loving them the best. However, there isnt much here for adults as far as rides go."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Space Mountain was a personal favorite along with the fireworks of course! The fireworks really make this pace seem like a fairytale   do not miss this.Tip for the ride junkies: the queues for the rides thins considerably after the fireworks so it is a good time to sneak away after the main firework display and experience the rides multiple times. :) :),Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Staff went a mile to make her feel at home and in a special place! Cannot fault Disneyland, what an experience.... Only downside were a minority of rude mainly mainland Chinese tourists thinking it was ok to take pictures and selfies with our daughter without asking   it was not and having blond hair and blue eyes is not an invitation.

"378406045,4,2016-5,United States,"" This Disneyland is much smaller than one in Los Angeles but nevertheless fun. The rides are different and creative. Highly recommend to come during a weekday and avoid possible wait. We came on a Tuesday, and the longest wait we had was 30 minutes most rides had a waiting time of 5 10 minutes. Check out the Mystic mansion ride, which shares a similar concept of the haunted mansion in the LA park but with a twist (more fun). It is my fav ride. Toy Story Land has a thrill ride called the RC rider, and it is U shaped coaster (not like a coaster but like the traditional pirate boat ride on a rail). For younger children, Pooh's house is a fun ride to check out! Do note that in May 2016, the Space Maintain is closed, and the Grizzly Mine car was on a two day maintenance when we visited on May 31st. Many Disneyland character showed up during our visit, and families and children can take pictures with them with ones' own phone or have professional picture taken. Food is expensive in general. Though about the same price as in LA Disneyland, they are still expensive overall   about HK $135 (~  US $20) a set of meal, HK $35 50 a snack (Micky shaped ice cream is HK $35), and HK $35 a bottle of water or soda. A key chain goes between HK $65 $135 depending on the material (plastic vs metal vs stuffed animal) and quality. Disneyland cookies and chocolate goes between HK $80 $198 depending on the flavor and quantity. A box of 16 butter cookies costs HK $88 but a box of mixed flavor cookies in an anniversary souvenir box goes up to HK $198. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most tour groups arrive around lunch time, so coming early will allow you to enjoy the rides without having to deal with long queues. It's easy to finish an area or two this way. Avoid coming on weekends or public holidays.

Or else you can just buy the single day ticket and enjoy it by visiting few rides but going around the complete place. Be prepared to break your legs by walking a lot. If you are staying in HK city, you can either come by hotel coaches, private tours, metro or cab to this location, but unfortunately all have to stop outside the entrance and then you have to start walking. The actual park from entrance is quite a distance but you can enjoy lot of things on the way.The main Avenue is the place where Mickey and Minnie visit every 2   3 hrs and you can click snaps and spend few minutes with them.The other characters are in and around that locations.It is well organized as they give you all details of timings for visiting these characters during the day. The timings of the parade during the day and also during night is also mentioned so that you can catch the appropriate place in the park for this parade.Rides are well categorized as per the child age and are quite interesting.

Start early by 10am and u r done for the day by 9pm. Carry small snackers for kids so that u don't waste tym at the restaurants. Cover maximum rides and shows on day 1 and the fotografy with celebs cud b done on the 2nd day if long queues exist.

375247269,5,2016-5,Australia,I had forgotten what the Disney experience is like. Disneyland was fun and easily accessible. The Disney train from Sunny Bay was lovely.I agree with earlier comments that this Disneyland is smaller than others however we all enjoyed our visit. Also I think this size suited our 2 and half year old and Granny.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"375024195,3,2016-5,Philippines,""I arrived in time for the afternoon parade, there were no queue lines so getting there was breezy. Seeing those disney characters alive was such a joy. After the parade, i was able to take a photo with goofy and pluto, but failed to see Mickey and minnie for it was already 6 in the evening and the queuing lines were closed, such a disappointment. i roamed around only to see that most of the attractions were already closed by 7pm. So i went back to the center only to find out that the evening parade had already started. There were too many people lined along the streets so it was hard to see the remaining of the parade. Lastly, i went in front of the castle, people were already seated and luckily i was able to find my own spot. I waited for at least 30minutes for the fireworks display and it was amazing, just wow! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"375008425,5,2016-5,Australia,""We attended with our 2 young kids. We had so much fun! Everything was really good I only have two issues with the place: 1. Only a small handful of people were able to take photos with characters. For example, they would only allow 40 or so people, and once the queue was filled they turned people away. Heartbreaking for little kids. 2. The food was horrible. I don't expect much from places like this for decent food, but the food was very expensive and not very nice at all. Other than that I definitely recommend a visit to HK Disneyland! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"374773276,3,2016-5,Philippines,""HK Disney was built on reclaimed land (formerly Penny's Bay). When the park initially opened, the theme lands were to the bare minimum. Layout is typical Disney. The architectural design is typical and nice planting design. There are 2 hotels (economical and luxury). Plenty of parking for private cars and buses. It's connected to various parts of Hong Kong and the New Territories by a clean and efficient rail system called the MTR. Every evening they have a nice fireworks display. The Disney experience is the same worldwide. Only the park facilities differ. HK Disney has the basic theme lands. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"374738433,3,2016-5,United Kingdom,""I know this park very well because I have been a season pass holder for two years. Of all the Disneylands I have been to this is probably the smallest of all, not quite designed for the western taste, there are very few rides, most of the attractions are just 'photo opportunities' that chinese people love and westernes and not so bothered about. On a quiet day you can ride all the rides at least once some even twice. The park is clean and the staff pleasant. All the queue areas are sheltered to protect people from the sun and rain. Some of the queue areas have ventilators that are much appreciated in thoses hot Hong Kong summer days. The restaurants terrible like all restaurants at all Disneyland resorts I've ever visited. And not cheap. You are much better off bringing your own food. The only thing worth eating are the mickey mouse waffles that they sell on the cafe at the main street, but if you buy one of those, I don't recommend that you sit on the tables at the back of the place to eat it, because it's full of very aggressive birds that steal the food and attack the children. I usually buy the waffle and eat it on one of the benches on the main street. The shops are quite cheap and the quality of the toys is very good, the t shirts are a bit so so. The only problem with the shop is that the clothes are tailored to the chinese taste so if you are a Westener you may struggle to find things that would want to wear and fit because of lack of large sizes."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Except for one, in my opinion, all other food establishments are so so and expensive."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

374406299,5,2016-4,Thailand,For a pleasant day trip I decided to visit Hong Kond Disneyland. I used the MTR (local trains) to get there and had no problems at all. I had to change trains at Central Station but there are pink Disneyland signs everwhere directing you to the correct train. To know which train lines and which stations to use refer to a MTR map which comes with the free Hong Kong maps you get at hotels and information booths. I went on a Tuesday and there were no crowds at all so I went on many rides. I enjoyed Toy Story Land the most where all the Toy Story characters were represented. There are many rides and attractions and I found it similar to Tokyo Disneyland. Highly recommended for a fun day.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I suggest you get discounted tickets at Klook.com they have tickets that come with a meal stub too which I think will make you save some money because food inside Disneyland is not cheap.

"374218728,4,2016-5,Singapore,""The Hong Kong Disneyland hotel front desk and service crews are friendly and the service is good. The Disneyland park crews not all are friendly. Encountered some crews when we approached them for stickers some give us unwillingly and not friendly. Maybe they have a bad day or hard day at work.We understand and sympathy them as majority of the tourist are from mainland China which are not easy tourist to deal with. Overall experience with the crew are good.Most people reviewed 1 day in the park will be enough to cover it which is not possible. Firstly most rides have long queues, the popular rides queues are even longer wait. The photo taking with the Disney characters are worse as they have limited queues. Some popular characters you have to queue 30 to 45mins in advance if not you will never have a chance to take photo with your favourite character.The shows are another killer too. If you don't queue 45min in advance you can never get to watch it.Tips of the day is to be careful of the mainland China people cutting your queues. They are the expert in cutting queues.The day parade and the night parade are totally different. Worth watching it and staying for the fireworks too.Too crowded to fully enjoy it.

"373651378,4,2016-5,Australia,""Loved Disneyland...... Great fun from the time we got there until we left.After reading reviews from other trip advisors, we decided to get an early start. We didn't have time to get tickets before we went, so we got them there. We expected huge crowds & a long queue, but to our surprise, there was no line. There was a bit of a line to get through the gates, but we got it within 5 minutes of gates being opened. The flyer for Disneyland stated that opening time was 9 am, so we got there at that time...wrong....didn't open until 10am, we could have had an extra hours sleep...hahaha.School holidays were finished, so that may account for the fewer crowds, even though it was a Saturday.The park itself was very well set out, we found all areas easily as they were well signposted. The lines for the rides were no longer than 25 minutes, which I thought was good. Would have liked them to have been a bit longer, but I guess they have a lot of people to get through. My favourite was Mystic Mountain. Tomorrowland was mostly closed due to a StarWars construction which unfortunately wasn't finished. I was looking forward to Tommorowland the most, so it was disappointing not to see most of it.The river cruise was fun, our guide was a scream & made us laugh all the way through it.Cinderellas Castle was pretty awesome, so was the train that goes around the park. The souvenir shops had all the same stuff in them, so we waited until we were leaving before buying anything. Everything was reasonably priced, which surprised me. I would have given 5 stars, except the food was atrocious & extremely expensive. The waffles were excellent, but that was all. We went to Grill, a food hall, and ordered a burger n fries. The burger looked like it was made of plastic....didn't taste much better either!!! For 2 burger meals ( burger, fries, water) cost us AU$45. Same thing at MacDonalds cost us AU$20 and tasted better....lol. Unfortunately you can't take food into the park, your bags are checked at entry, so unless you have a bag with a hidden compartment, you have no option but to buy their food. Or have a humougous breakfast...hahaha.All in all had a great time, I would definitely visit again. We have no kids, just 2 oldies reliving our youth, but it was well worth it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"373596988,5,2015-12,India,""When you're here you are guaranteed to have the time of your life. Avoid visiting during peak season as there are big queues for rides. Get the fastpass this will help you skip the queue. If you missed to take pictures with your favourite disney characters make sure to check with the staff about the return time of the characters.

Therefore, we always purchase the VIP tours as can't imagine queuing up several hrs for one ride with 2 young kids. VIP service is good,and efficient. Rides there cater more for the under 8yr olds. I guess teens would definitely find them too tame. Watch out for the mainlanders there though we hired their push chairs for our youngest child and their name was written clearly in English. After the ride we went to pick the push chair and saw a chinese woman put her child in it and walk off. My husband in his broken mandarin told her that it was our chair. Instead of apologising, she had the audacity to shout and yell at him that the name was in English and why we didn't put a chinese name on it !!!

The 'festival of lion king' and 'Mickey and wonderous book'   shows are highly recommended. Downside is the photo taking timing is not available on the brochure and you can only know when you are there. If you are staying at Disneyland hotel, have breakfast at enchanted garden whereby main Disney characters (Mickey, Minnie, goofy, Pluto) will be out to take photos with you. In this way, you can save time queueing to take photo in Disneyland. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Tomorrowland was mostly closed to set up for a weekend event, but there was plenty to do. May not be a two day park unless you want all the shows.

While we were able to accomplish almost everything we wanted to do in one day, the second day was nice to revisit and really see everything. Emphasis is less on big rides and more on shows and other types of experiences. We went on a Monday and Tuesday, and rides like Mystic Manor and Grizzly were 5 minute waits (and both are really, really great rides). On the other hand Mickey and the Wondrous Book and the Paint the Night parade were really crowded (but also great!).Crowds are smaller so expect some restaurants to not open and lands to open in shifts. And if it does rain like it did on our second day, there aren't as many places to wait it out.Not necessarily worth a trip to HKDL as a destination, but if you are in the area and like Disney, you'll definitely like this."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"372482712,5,2016-5,Australia,""HK Disneyland is a truly magical place. It's smaller than the other parks, but this allows you to actually see everything in a day (albeit a long one). On my third trip there since it opened I was again delighted with my experience. My highlights and must sees are:  Lion King show  Space mountain   Mystic Manor ride  nighttime parade  fireworks The newer lands (grizzly gulch, mystic manor and toy story) offer more rides and attractions. As always, they are impeccably themed. The new roller coaster in grizzly gulch will impress those who are used to the US Disneylands which feature more rides. Tomorrow land is undergoing an extensive renovation to allow for new attractions featuring the Marvel characters and Star Wars. Space Mountain was closed on this visit, but I've been on it before and it's always fun. The Buzz Light year ride is still open with short queues. The fine print:  read the show times carefully and expect the characters to disappear prior to the show parade during the day  use a fast pass if you really want to go on a ride  plan for a whole day   the MTR is the easiest way to access the park unless you are staying at a nearby resort  luggage can be checked in  no selfie sticks allowed   don't take a guided tour   you won't get enough time "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"372265281,3,2016-5,Australia,""I spent 5 hours here and was left feeling a little dissapointed. This was my first time at any Disneyland and I had high hopes of 'magic' and thrills, but only really found these at the live shows which are exceptional and definitely not to be missed. Watching the 'Festival of the Lion King' bought a tear to my eye and 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' was also excellent, although slightly marred by the technical glitch during the performance. These very talented performers made the entrance price seem reasonable. I also appreciated the Valet service for left luggage, and parcel delivery at the gate to save carrying parcels around with you On the down side the supposed 'world famous' Jungle River Cruise was certainly not worth queuing up for 20 minutes for, and somewhat underwhelming despite our excellent guide Eric's enthusiasm. The 'It's a Small World' ride was awful in my opinion, probably only suitable for very small children. Tarzan tree house is not worth it either sadly. Next time I will bring my children, and stay for the night parade and fireworks display where I'm sure is sprinkled with magic. Also I will purchase from the Disney store at the airport rather than queuing to buy here."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"372200109,3,2016-4,New Zealand,""My wife and I visited HK Disneyland during a layover between flights. We were hoping it would be just like the one in LA. While it was nicely landscaped and pleasant to walk around, we felt that it was very much geared to families with small children     not teenagers or big kids (like us). It had no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Haunted Mansion, no Pirates of the Caribbean, no Star Tours. They were building an Ironman ride though. It seemed to us, that all the types of rides we were hoping for had been replaced with expensive food outlets and gift shops. So the admission cost was not really value for money in our opinion. Fortunately, the park was not that busy, and we didn't have to fight the queues. We did the whole park in about 3 hours, but left feeling disappointed."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
371966518,5,2016-5,New Zealand,Everything about our Disney experience was pure Disney magic. So easy to get there on the MTR and the Disneyland train   30m end to end. From the moment you get off the train you are surrounded by Disney perfection right down to the manhole covers all stamped with the Mickey Mouse icon. The park is geared to hold about 5 times more people than were there so we went to the front of the line straight away on almost everything waiting 5 15 max anywhere including the line to get pictures with Mickey & Minnie   perfect when traveling with a 5 year old. We were there for 7 hours on day 1 and 4 hours on day 2 and could easily have had a third day   so much to see and do   we never stopped and didn't have to wait in line and still only just got around the rides. We did however ride the Buzz Lightyear ride 6 times and Small World twice. We only made it to one show and part of Tomorrowland is closed while they make way for new Star Wars attractions. We saw the 3pm parade on day 1 and both the evening light show and fireworks on Day 2 all of which were excellent. We took our own food (I think they just stop you from bringing packaged goods in like cans of drink because they would breach their licensing arrangements) so I can't comment on the food option but one water and one Coke cost HKG$58 so it's not cheap.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The rides were great, also maybe because it was a school day the lines were great, 15 min max for each ride  attraction. The longest line was probably the one to take a picture with Mickey  around 25 min, but we had to take a picture with him! We were 4 grown adults with no kids and still loved the park.

I could say that by only watching that the money for the ticket price is really worth it.The rides are awesome and very fun for all ages even my mother of 54 had really enjoyed everything.My son loves Toy Story and we were all excited to jump over. It looks so fun and colorful but I just don't like the idea that big grasses are lying next to the rides and shops. They can still enhance the area for more interesting decorations.The last stop was the parade at night and fireworks which no one should missed this as this is the highlight of your DisneXperience.

"371043809,4,2015-12,Canada,""It's Disneyland! So, I am sure there are enough general information about the rides. I will write on my specific experience.FacilitiesAs good as any other Disneyland. Wheelchair and stroller friendly, diaper changing facilities etc. I do wish they are designated breastfeeding rooms. I breastfeed in public, no problem. However, it would be great to have rooms for some moms who prefer to breastfeed in privacy.RulesI am not keen on their must have shoes policies even for babies that still needed to be carried. My baby could not walk yet at that time, and every ride and attraction that is baby friendly including the short raft ferry to the tree for Tarzan, we had to put his shoes on. At that point, my baby had the habit of taking his shoes off and throwing. So either my hubby or I who is not the one carrying the baby, would have to hold on to his feet or his hands to keep the shoes on. We were most worried during rides that fly as we didn't want his shoes landing on anybody's face nor head. And we were also worried that his shoes would be thrown into the river during the jungle cruise ride. I would understand if he was a baby that could walk, shoes would be needed to keep his feet safe. However, for a baby that cannot talk (cannot be explained why he has to keep his shoes on) and cannot walk (needs to be held, carried) I don't get the point. He was wearing sock booties and yet shoes were insisted. Lucky, that I brought his shoes in my backpack, otherwise he wouldn't be allowed on any ride attraction. Why are sock booties not enough for a baby at that stage of his life? Why does a small baby need to have shoes on?I loved everything about my experience that day, my older 7 year old son was happy. the place is as clean as Disneyland Anaheim, But, oh that shoe policy is annoying."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Start of our fantastic journey!We went over to the fire brigade station to rent a stroller n was advised by the staff to ride the train before renting strollers as it only travels one way..

It doesn't allow us to go all the way back to the main entrance... Really doesn't make any sense. So since we are already at fantasy land, we decided to take the rides there. Dumbo the elephant, the carousell (waited ard 20mins each which was not too bad). After which we went over to Winnie the Pooh ride to get ourselves fast pass (there are only 2rides in Disney which allows fast pass). It was 3pm n the timing on the fast pass was 5.20pm???

To be honest I'm glad, the longest we had to wait for a ride or attraction (apart from meeting Mickey Mouse) was 20 mins.It's well connected to Knowloon and Central with the MTR connection at Sandy Bay, and really cheap too. About   2.50 one way. There's a short walk from the station to the main gate. I recommend buying your tickets online in advance, we were able to walk right up to the turnstiles without queuing up for tickets and go straight through. Sleeping Beauty's castle is much smaller than I expected, I don't know what the other parks are like but I kind of hoped you could go in.There's lots of restaurants and plenty of choices for food western or Chinese again for a reasonable price. I was a bit disappointed with the  haunted house  nothing more than loud noises and fast motion. You get put in a car and shoved around in all directions. I went with my one year old and three year old they loved it! There wasn't too many over 4ft rides they both loved the it's a small world ride.

"369717469,4,2016-5,United Kingdom,""I'm producing a review more like a trip report so that people can make more of an informed choice as to whether they want to visit and if so when. There are lots of negative reviews on here but a lot are from people that visited in the Chinese school summer holidays. We visited the first weekend in May.We bought two day tickets as it was on offer so only $20 HK more. We were also staying on site. We arrived Sunday afternoon around 1pm and decided to just walk around. The queue for astro blasters was only 5 minutes so we went on that and it's a small world was 10 minutes. We also arrived at philharmagic at show time so saw that too. The park was busy but not crowded. By about 3pm queues were 30 mins plus. We only waited 5 mins for a pic with Mickey. We had lunch at the starlight diner which was horrid. Burgers tasted like the worst school dinners. We looked in all the shops and the items are pretty similar with very few items location specific (and all can be bought in main Street) We left the park just after the 3pm parade and returned later for paint the night. We arrived 5 minutes before the start and found that the crowd consisted of 1 row of people seated on the kerb so we were able to stand immediately behind. Quite a novelty. After the parade we walked straight onto space mountain and went to astro blasters again before going to watch the fireworks at 8.30. Once again it wasn't very crowded. I had plenty of room around me and we were standing at the top of mainstreet. The fireworks were nice but not as wow as the anniversary celebrations in Anaheim. The next morning we walked to the park which has a nice atmosphere. We arrived just after the 10.30 opening and headed straight to grizzly gulch. The wait for the runaway mine cars was 5 mins. This was a nice ride. Less rattly than Thunder mountain but the layout was like a tamer expedition everest We then went to Mystic Manor. We were able to walk straight on. This was a really well done ride. Very enjoyable and clever. We rode again straight away. Then over to toy story land. Queue for the parachute ride was 15 minutes. It was an OK ride. Lots of faffing around loading. Then 5 mins wait for RC racer. An excellent and fun ride. (We skipped slinky dog as we don't have kids but the q was only 5 mins). It was now about midday.We had lunch at the royal banquet Hall. Once again horrid. There was not enough seating. The serving staff were grumpy and just smashed plates on to the tray and the food wasnt good. DH had the pork bento box which was passable theme park food. I had the Chinese chicken and mushroom which was awful. The chicken was stuffed with bone and shards and was inedible. Not great for a   30   lunch. The queue for Winnie the Pooh was 45 mins so we got a fastpass for 6 7pm. The queues for rides were all about 30mins  so we just went to astro blasters as that was 5mins and then headed over to the 2pm showing of festival of the lion king. It was quite good although Rafiki wasn't that good a singer. Our cunning plan was then to go to the shops whilst the parade was on but it started raining so that was then a trying experience. We grabbed a Mickey waffle (the one nice thing we had to eat in that park) and headed back to our hotel.We returned to the park just before 7 to use our Pooh fastpass. Then went to Mickey's wondrous book at 7.30. This was a super show. We headed to space mountain where there were no queues and rode that a couple of times before the firework show. Main Street was even less crowded then the previous night. We headed about halfway down which was a better position then the previous night as we could clearly see the projections on the castle. The only problem was that the misty humid weather obliterated some of the view of the fireworks. This is not a park for thrill seekers or probably teenagers. It is a park for smaller children and Disney lovers. The park was easy to get around when we were there and the queues weren't bad at all. My advice is get there first thing and don't bother visiting in the afternoon. There have been a number of comments about the mainland Chinese visitors. The park was not busy when we were there and apart from being very loud, repeatedly using their flash in the shows and being a bit pushy going into the shows we didn't have any problems. Everyone was queuing fine and the staff were trying to be on top of any queue jumping. The toilets in the park were only just OK despite there being staff.The staff in Mystic point, Grizzly gulch and toy story land were very Disney. Lots of smiles and waves. The staff in its a small world were the opposite. I think it is the staff which means that this visit is missing something. There is just not that smiling and friendliness across the board. We also found the stock in the shops very limited. Most of the garments were Mickey, Minnie, Donald, ensemble, stitch or star wars Women also had the option to have cinderella but no star wars. Children's stuff was obviously princess or avengers or cars. No animals or villains. I was also very disappointed that there werent any Xmas baubles. Pricing varied. Some things were far cheaper than US Disney others massively more expensive. There were quite a few characters around on the Sunday and Monday. Mickey and Minnie were at the entrance when we arrived at opening and they were also there when we returned at 7 on Monday.Mickey and Minnie were in the fantasy gardens both days.Donald and daisy were on main Street both days.Chip and dale were in grizzly gulch both days.Buzz lightyear and woody were in Toy story land both days Tinkerbell and at least one princess were in the fairy tale forest both days.Baymax was in art of animation both days.Lotso bear was in main Street on the Sunday. We saw piano entertainers on main Street, broom art near the jungle cruise and drumming near astro blasters. Be aware you can't take big bags into the park and will be required to store them.The weather when we visited was pleasant. It was comfortable walking around. Be aware that they seem to cancel the parade at the drop of a hat and certainly with less rain then in the US. An umbrella is $160 hkd and a poncho $65 so be prepared if you don't want to pay.Transport to and from the hotels was excellent. The hotels are 15 mins walk (disneyland hotel) and 30 mins walk (Hollywood) at an ambling pace. The park was very clean when we visited.I believe that food and drink is removed if you try to bring it in but double check before you visit ( we didn't try). It might be better value and experience to leave the park to have lunch at one of the hotels then return (make sure to get your hand stamped  they won't offer) We had a nice time and we are glad we visited but we wouldn't fly to Hong Kong specifically to visit here whereas we would to Anaheim "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"369563288,5,2016-5,New Zealand,""It was easy to reach this place via metro rail. Admission fees is HK539 adult if you have not booked online. There are several packages available online. The admission price includes all rides . Please bring extra cash with you , there are yummy things to eat and you will definitely want to try some of them,especially if you have children. Multiple rides , best ones includes river cruise which you shouldn't miss . 4D theatre which is called magical theatre is a must as well . The rides can be done in a day if you start at 10 am on a weekday but it will be in a hurry otherwise better to complete all rides in 2 days which you will enjoy.Don't forget the fireworks at the castle which starts at 2030 hours .

"369435771,4,2016-4,Hong Kong,""I visit Hong Kong Disneyland at least twice a year even thought it is the smallest one because it is a rare place to have fun and fresh air in Hong Kong. Usually I will visit the theme park during weekdays in order to avoid long queues.  Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters  is the funniest attraction item and you can shoot the aliens as a space ranger.  Stitch Encounter  is also interesting with interaction between audiences and Stitch.  It's a Small World  is highly recommended if you feel tired or sweating under hot weather. Air conditioning is available since you queuing up and you can take a rest during the boat trip :)For  thrilling  attraction items, you can try  Space Mountain ,  RC Racer  and  Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars .It only takes around half day to play all attraction items if you visit the park during weekdays. Reserve more time for queuing up if you will be there at the weekend or public holidays.As a local visitor, I usually don't dine at the park as it is expensive. But for tourists, it is a nice try at the Plaza Inn (Chinese restaurant) for dim sum (some of them are in Mickey's shape) and the Main Street Corner Cafe. The food quality of the fast food restaurants at the park is just so so. Friendly reminder: Don't miss the parade and fireworks show at night."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We have two teenage boys and they only had limited choice in rides which suited them (although their mother insisted they go on the Small, Small World ride much to their disgust).

Lines to rides not too bad in the morning but were really long for some things later in the day. Some brilliant rides   displays   its a small world was probably my favourite and the boat ride was fun. Tried most of the rides   they are not very long and you will spend longer waiting than the ride takes. Food was expensive, but this is typical of all theme parks. The grounds were lovely and there was a nice vibe in the place. I found many of the staff did not look terribly happy or smiley, which I would expect in a Disney environment, but perhaps they were just having a bad day.

"368989494,4,2016-4,Singapore,""My daughter is so fond Disney characters and her wish came true. Some advice if you are new to Hong Kong Disneyland. 1. Buy the tickets online to save time.2. Come early to the park. 3. There are two lines when you enter into theme park. First one is 'normal' tickets and second one is for Automatic tickets. Go for later Q ..The Automatic tickets has QR code and can be collected immediately without a delay. You can ask Staff to guide for this Q. 4. My daughter was jumping when she saw Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse character and I started Queuing up. Major disappoint was when we were stopped by staff and told that it's too much crowd. I told him that lady came just before me and you can't stop like this. My wife started to arguing to staff and called the person in charge. During that time lady in front of me and staff were mocking us & even tried to blocking to enter into that area. My daughter started crying. We left, do not ruin the entire day and moved on. 5. First area is Main Street, USA and 2 major parades in street. 1. Flights of Fantasy (3 pm) and 2. Disney Paint the Night (8:30 pm). Flights of Fantasy is a must.. it's too colorful, full of dance & music. 6. Second aera is Tomorrowland. Major attraction is Space Mountain. 7. Third are is Fantasy land and favorite for girls. Cinderella and Queens are main attractions. We were able to get picture with Minnie Mouse this time around. 7. Because we came early, that's why we took cab. We stayed at InterContinental hotel, the Cab fare was HK$ 200. We took MTR way back to Hotel. As a whole, it's wonderful day. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

368686783,5,2015-12,South Africa,Not to be missed when you are in Hong Kong. Be sure to take a timetable and view the show times and characters that will be doing their rounds. I made a mistake by not doing this and missed the Frozen ladies twice which left my daughter bitterly disappointed. Also make sure you do this over 2 days in my opinion. 1 day get there late afternoon so that you can stay and watch the fireworks at the end. And on another day get there early so you can leave early and still do some other things. Although keeping in mind that this park is not huge and can be done in 1 day. It just depends if you have small kids with you that might get restless like we did. Food is expensive but you don't have much of a choice but to buy there. Also try and buy tickets before hand on line or at the airport   you might get a better deal and also avoid the queues. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, to maximise your experience, you should learn to strategise the visit";" such as looking for some blogs through internet about HK Disneyland, try to get some tips there from what attractions that you should not to miss out, which attraction to visit first etc. It helped us a lot that is why we've got the best out of our visit.

I would recommend arriving early and rush through the rides you really want to make it on and then spend the afternoon at shows etc. We were in line to enter the park approx half an hour before the park opened unfortunately there is no shade and no cold drinks available so prepare for this. It is ridiculously hot to be standing in the sun with small children. We loved the parade and shows. We only spent one day at the park we could easily have filled in a second day.The park gets very crowded by afternoon so morning is definitely the best option for little kids that don't cope well with queues.

Space Mountain and the Grizzly mine cart ride were the only  thrill  type rides and I use that term loosely. Yes its Disneyland but even some of the glamour and shine were just not there. Food outlets were mostly closed with a few of the restaurants and vendors dotted around with basic offerings   I guess due to it being off season? It was clean. I loved the natural surrounds and the greenery, trees and landscaping   made it all very lovely in parts, but the rest of the park needs work.Great place to take your princess loving little girls, some of the dresses you can buy are too cute!

Remove the 'California Adventure' part. Then takes what's left and sort of 'reduce it down' and you have Hong Kong Disneyland. Not terrible, but also rather small and   again   sort of reduced and minimized. They also have a strange opening procedure...I got there early and actually waited in line for the front gate to open, which was fine. However once in they only allow you on Main Street USA at first, keeping you from entering the actual park for about 30 minutes. After THAT, they do a sort of 'rolling opening' of the lands (and don't tell you which open first) so not EVERYTHING is available to do right when you get there. I went to the left to head to Mystic Manor (a GREAT ride, BTW!), only to be stopped and told that area was not opening for another 30 minutes.

367072630,5,2015-12,India,Every child   adult should visit Disneyland once in their lifetime to enjoy their childhood memories.

"367068942,5,2016-4,Australia,""This was our second trip to HK Disney. This time we travelled with a large group who has the pleasure of performing as part of the wonderful Disney Performing Arts Program. Around the performance the kids had the chance to explore the park and go on loads of rides. We loved Space Mountain as always and the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. It was a shame that the Grizzly ride was closed for renovation. I was surprised that the park is still quite small 8 years after our initial visit. You can definitely explore the whole park in one day whereas the US Disneys are far larger. The parades, especially the night time parade, are spectacular and worth timing your ride schedule around. The performers are amazing and the light display very impressive.Food was a little challenging for vegetarians until we found the Explorers Cafe. Awesome Javanese Curry!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

This year was our 2nd visit in mid March 2016 on a weekday and my 2 older children have now turned into teens except for my youngest girl who is 8 yrs old. Brought my teen nephew along & this time around was so much more fun partly due to the nice cooling weather & much shorter queue. I would definitely recommend to visit Hong Kong in March.

The rides are obviously tailored for local attraction and not what westerners would think are really great. Not a whole lot to do, it was very basic, and for the price we thought very let down by a Disney product. I wouldn't recommend to anyone wanting the Disney experience to go here.

We also had a great time in Toy Story Land, which wasn't there the last time we visited.While bad weather on a Sunday kept us ducking for cover for a couple of hours, the trip was memorable enough for us to begin planning our next visit.

There are many rides in different categories at the park such as adventureland, fantasyland and so on. There is also a very cute MTR from Sunny Bay station known as Disneyland Express which takes you to Disneyland. In addition there are many souvenir shops in the park and few food courts.

I have been to Disney parks in the US and this one is smaller than those but it's a good one especially if you have young kids with you. It wasn't very crowded for the rides perhaps because it was a weekend and except Autopia and Dumbo the Elephant, we didn't have to wait too long for the rides. My recommended rides if you have kids with you: Mickey's 4d show, Dumbo the Elephant, Autopia, Jungle river cruise, Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Also, the parades (one around 3pm and another around 7:30pm) and the fireworks at closing are nice. Suggest going early when it isn't crowded."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We could of done with another half day but was happy with what we managed to complete with 2 young children. Park was very clean and well maintained and the Main St had the same feel as the one in Magic Kingdom in Florida.

The teenagers were very excited to be able to now ride on the rides that they couldn't last time as they were too young. They were disappointed that there were not the great rides and roller coasters that are at the other Disneylands. Most of the rides were child oriented, not so much for teenagers. Anyway, we still had a great day. It is quite small, so easily done in a day, which is good as it was really hot. The Lion King show was fantastic and a highlight. The lines were ok, we ended up going on the  single rider  line as it was way shorter and we didn't care that we didn't sit together because we got a lot more rides this way.

Me and my husband shared a crazy day out there. I relived my childhood days. Its a must visit for families with young kids. The food in the park is quite expensive, so preferably carry a bit with you. Also the options for vegetarians is very less and whatever is available is not worth a shot. Also some travel agents suggest you to stay at the Disney Hotel and take a two day pass but trust me not worth your time as the check in procedure takes hours and you waste a lot of time. Also the rooms are really tiny. Its better to commute through the Disney Metro and take a one day pass and enjoy there in one day. Also they don't allow you to take pictures with a selfie stick, so its better not to carry one.

The queues were bearable except some which you may have to wait 45 minsThe tram that goes around disney is usually two way. So we parked the stroller at Fantasy land. Only when we were queuing then they made the announcement that all passengers have to alight at the main station which means we have to walk all the way back to get our stroller. Prepare you video cameras cos right after fantasy land, into tomorrowland, There will be little monsters greeting the passengers.

But the food options are really quite limited. dragged her daughter and right past everyone to stand in front for Elsa photo taking. Even after they told her nicely, she became fierce. Most are ok but you have to stand firm and tell them to please not jump q. Some will just ignore you. HahahaThe crowd. The crowd! Where do I start? Where do these people come from. All of a sudden, just before the night parade, throngs of people started appearing from everywhere. It was so crowded, it was impossible to walk. Right after the parade, everyone rushed to the shops. It was IMPOSSIBLE to walk. The people jumped over our stroller, stepped on our feet, without any apologies, like that was the way to go. The park guests were so rude and horrid. They cough into your face and do not queue. Earlier in the day, one Mainland chinese mother,blatantly ignored everyone in the q, she walked past everyone and stood right in front of the queue. When told that she has to q, she became fierce and ignored the comments. How scary...If you are staying at the Disney Hotels, there are frequent bus shuttle services that will bring you to Disneyland but its still a good ten min walk away. If you are travelling with kids, better bring whatever they need. For those who do not wish to pay the entrance fees and still would like to catch the fireworks, feel free to wait at the entrance. There is a nice fountain where you can take pics while waiting for the fireworks to start.Go there knowing that you will have to brave the crowd, you will have fun and survive.

365902952,5,2015-10,Australia,Hong Kong Disneyland is a must go and see attraction especially if you have kids. I have been to other Disneyland's in other countries before and common remark is although they are a great attraction they are more suited towards kids rather than adults.

After we had checked in, we went to the Park immediately, I have played many motorized game and saw many show which was made by the Disney too. We also bought many Disney Products there and toke photo with the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. I thought that the DisneyLand Park was really suitable for the kids to go. All of the products and services were designed with ideas of Disneyland. Even through the things inside the hotels are also designed by ideas of disney too.

"365486539,4,2016-4,United Kingdom,""We arrived here early afternoon for the day, I'd bought tickets online and was impressed with the price.I went to a ticket machine, no queue at all. Great start.We got right in and there were a lot of characters around the entrance, all of the queues were closed which was disappointing for the kids   why not stagger the times?The overall park felt good, the gardens were stunning. I don't want to compare to Disneyworld in Florida but really the feel of the park was the same   magical.Loved seeing mountains around the park though!The park is smaller but I really don't think it feels small. There was plenty to do. Lots of resturaunts & shops.The queues were not a bad length for most rides, but when watching the staff it really looks like they could organise the crowds much better to reduce waiting times.For example, when rides were exiting on one side the next people weren't through the first gates which meant a longer wait to fill the next ride and longer queues for everyone.More common sense required here! Could be run so much better than it is.Can't remember where we ate but the food was actually really good. Everyone was happy with their meals.LOVED Toy story land! Amazing.The gardens were also something you can't see in Florida. Loved the Tangled area.We seen a few characters later, again they all arrived in the same areas at the same time   this is so silly and not fair for the kids who want to meet a lot of characters.Poor planning.This was the only day it rained whilst we were in Hong Kong but we just bought ponchos & got on with it. The ponchos were pretty pricy, don't see the need for this (global bugbear of mine to take advantage)The park emptied pretty quickly which was actually a huge bonus as some rides had no queues!I was really excited to see the fireworks and electric parade and was sad when these were later cancelled due to the rain.The electric parade looks amazing.Left earlier than planned and jumped in a taxi back to my hotel. The taxi rank was huge and confusing. I asked a few drivers who all directed me to a different zone?All in all a great day was had by all.If you go to Hong Kong with kids I'd say this is a must do.Try not to compare with any other park, just go & enjoy youself.

We stayed at Kingdom club in Disney hotel so had special entry gate to right end of gate options which made entry quick & easy. When we booked our Disney tickets we were unsure if we were wasting a day of our time in Hong Kong. But we had a fabulous day which was without a doubt our best Disney park experience. We initially though that normal theme park might queue for rides long time, cost, quality of food and overall experience. However, Hong Kong Disneyland is the opposite it wasn't too busy, granted it was a weekday and not peak season. There were no hour long lines for rides most were 5 15 mins so you can do all the rides in one day. It is a well structured park and it was nice to be able to get character photos with just a couple of minutes wait not long lines. Besides, Street parade is great, best spot is between the Disney castle and street as the parade stopped there for quite a while for static entertainment which only a limited number of people saw.The food selection was good, well priced and there were healthy options.

The ride to disney is pretty far away from where my hotel locates at but took us about 1 and a half hours to get there.  When we got to Disneyland, there was so much people, especially its a Saturday. My dad, who didn't come with us told us that Disneyland in Hong Kong comparing it to other ones is really small. At first I believed him but when we got there, there was so much people that I knew, I couldn't play every activity that I want, which is so true. At lunch, we were the at Tomorrowland where they sell junk food. We got this coupon to get a meal but it was junk food and we were starving so we got it. It was really expensive...luckily we got the coupon.  My mom brought the ticket online for about 137 dollars (I can't remember the whole price) with the coupon so why not get it.

Unlike the rest of Hong Kong there is tons of open space and the long entry way really surprised me! The park was fun with some classic favorites and some rides that were new to me. I was really impressed with the cast members and honestly it wasn't very expensive. I wouldn't say it's a multi day park but worth a visit. We stayed at the Disney Hollywood hotel and they have bus service that's free but the easiest way there is on the MTR.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364982492,5,2016-4,Thailand,""Over my Songkran Break (a festival that we celebrate in Thailand) my family and I went to Hong Kong. It was a family trip, and we had so much fun. I think the highlight of this trip is going to Disneyland. Most of my cousins are still young, so they all enjoyed Disneyland.  There are many sections inside Disneyland, but my favorite one is Tomorrowland. It gives you a feeling that you are in the future. Adventureland is also realistic, which gives you a feeling of you walking in the jungle. In Adventureland, you can also cruise the river in a boat. During the boat ride, you get to adventure into the jungle and meet many creatures living inside. Another good thing about Disneyland in Hong Kong is that you don   t have to wait that long for a ride. I was in Disneyland for only about five hours and I got to get on eight rides. You only have to wait about twenty minutes for each ride, which isn   t considered long compared to other theme parks. The food in Disneyland is considered decent. I wouldn   t say that it is that delicious, but it isn   t that bad either. However, the price of the food is very high, considering the quality and the amount that they give us. The merchandise is also expensive, but there are many things to buy in Disneyland.  Overall, I would say that I had a great experience in Disneyland. My whole family had fun. I would look forward to coming here again someday."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364931517,5,2016-4,Philippines,""You'll never tire going around Hongkong Disneyland, if it's your 1st time to see the theme park. Most of the people I saw at theme park are not 1st time goers. For some, it would take a 2 Day pass to really savour and see all of the theme park. For me, 1 Day pass is enough provided I enter the theme park at opening hours and leave at closing hours.I'm lucky to see 2 parades out of 2 parades for the day and meet and have a photo opporutnity with 6 characters out of a multitude of characters going around during the day. I also had taken 3 autogaphs out of the 6 characters.What best way to spend your birthday than to stay the whole day in theme park. I missed claiming my birthday gift pack or birthday pin arriving 3 days after my birthday.Meals can be pricey it depends upon your budget. Some restaurants can be booked by reservation so that you are assured of a place to eat. I love the Grill at the Royal Banquet Hall and the cute sweet treats at Market St. Bakery.I did not find any postcard of Hongkong Disney specially since it's almost the end of their 10th year Anniversary celebration."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
364885483,4,2016-1,United States,The park is great but if you are going to charge me $$$$ for food you should at least make it better quality than dog food!!

"364770863,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,""This was our first time visiting any of the Disneyland Resorts and we were really pleased with the experience. We got the MRT from Hong Kong station to Disneyland and it was very easy. The train from Sunny Bay was amazing and an experience in itself, the train had Mickey Mouse shaped windows..that alone raised the excitement levels. We queued for tickets when we arrived and it was really quick and efficient, didn't take more than 5 minutes. All of the workers were really friendly and helpful, especially when we met some of the characters..they showed great patience and enthusiasm. We had a great day out & would highly recommend."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364760633,4,2016-4,Netherlands,""Having visited Euro Disney in Paris the park in Hong Kong is a deja vu. Similar layout and easy to find routes and attractions. Had a nice day and as we visited on a week day (Wednesday) all attractions were walk on (or max 5 minutes waiting time). Visit early as the locals don't like a early start and come in after lunch. Still the park remained relatively empty all day (in the afternoon still no queues). Only queues there,  30 minutes, for character meet&greet."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"364744829,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,""When we booked our Disney tickets we were unsure if we were wasting a day of our time in Hong Kong. But we had a fabulous day which was without a doubt our best Disney park experience. We had been to Orlando a couple of times and were severely disappointed with the queues, cost, quality of food and overall experience. Hong Kong Disneyland is the opposite it wasn't too busy, granted it was a weekday and not peak season (but we never went to Orlando in peak either). There were no hour long lines for rides most were 5 15 mins so you can do all the rides in one day. It is a well structured park and it was nice to be able to get character photos with just a couple of minutes wait not long lines like in the other Disney parks. The food selection was good, well priced and there were healthy options. If you haven't been to a Disney park yet go to this one first. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364733464,5,2016-3,Australia,""We took the Mickey mouse train the 1 stop to the park, kids (4&5yr old girls) loved it, especially the princess sculptures, even the overhead grab handles were Mickey themed. We stayed at Kingdom club in Disney hotel so had special entry gate to right end of gate options which made entry quick & easy. Big tip: turn left after going thru entry to start of Main street and go into the information centre (ask for directions at entry gate if unsure). They gave us a program & timetable of where & when the Disney princesses and characters appear for photos and autographs for the day. We got there early each time, minimal queuing and planned our day around the program. We got around the park in 2 days but a 3rd would've been better, or if our 1st day was as well planned as our 2nd day. Don't pack bulky raincoats, we bought some cheap, lightweight ones within a few mins of needing them so save valuable luggage space. Huge range of Pandora Disney Hong Kong pendants, Disney pendants & limited edition ones & Pandora shops all through the park and at Disney hotel, although stock significantly depleted since my wife's onslaught.On shopping, the train station you catch the Mickey mouse train from (to the park) is actually attached to an enormous factory outlet (DFO) store (again, stock depleted as per above). We did struggle to find western food in the park & what we found wasn't good (what's with chicken sausages hotdogs & Pluto pups).Quite a lot of rides were closed on our visit, maybe low season or just bad luck but consider that 3rd day if everything is running. Street parade is great, best spot is between the Disney castle and street as the parade stopped there for quite a while for static entertainment which only a limited number of people saw. Night parade we saw only from Kingdom club verandah but timed to fireworks so worth seeing, our kids were too tired to stay that late. Overall a great experience, worth the trip."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364723625,1,2015-5,United Kingdom,""My wife and I went here on out last day in HK for a bit of fun, just the two of us.

364706693,4,2016-4,Bahrain,One day is not enough specially on weekend as there was a lot of people and you need to queue for a minimum of 45mins in each ride.Make sure that 30mins before the start of Disney Street Parade you already find and get your place in the main street for a better view and pictures. ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364609280,4,2016-4,Finland,""We visited on Thursday, trying to avoid the biggest crowd and actually managed to do that. HK Disney is small enough to go trough in one day when there's not too many visitors. The longest queue was app. 15 minutes, so we didn't have to waste time for standing in line.We had a great day, the only reason for four stars is that one of the sites (Grizzly Gulch) wasn't operating at all. "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364600820,4,2016-4,Singapore,""Going to HK Disneyland for the 1st time was just a breeze. You can take the MTR (yellow line) from central towards sunny bay and transfer to the pink line towards disneyland resort station. Its as simple as following the bright eyed tourists with kids and there's no way you'll miss itAs many other theme parks, there are many spots here that are instagram worthy. They are also famous as backdrops for tv and movie shoots (and i was lucky to see one  fanmode). Rides wise, as an adult I'd say the USS in SG is more exhilarating but hey, Disney is designed for kids afterall and people like me who are kids at heart. If you want the rush, the Space Mountain is a must try. Tarzan's TreeHouse was such a waste of time. You take a short raft ride to the other side, climb the tree house, come down and ride the raft back.. I find it really boring but I still got pics. 2 of the rides in adventureland were under maintenance so that cut our visit short. Buzz Lightyear's ride was also interactive especially designed for kids. Pictures with your favorite Disney characters were also queued on so you have to be quick if you wanted Mickey's pic as its queue could last ages. The place had many restos and shops to choose from... Perhaps the best thing i should say about this trip was the Disney Parades and the fireworks at the end. It sure lived up to expectations and like a kid, i was grinning and smiling and waving like crazy. Make sure you catch the Flights of Fantasy at around 3pm.. but the best one is Mickey's Fantasy of Lights. It was just awesome. Make sure you get a good seat around 5pm and get a good view of Cinderella's Castle as its the best spot to catch the parades as well as the fireworks after. Its an absolute must see.The crowds would be very heavy after the fireworks towards the MTR so its best to stay awhile to maybe get some photos or do some last minute shopping for souvenirs and wait for the crowd to lessen before hitting your way back. Overall, it was a great experience."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364532667,5,2016-3,Hong Kong,""The rollercoaster  Space Mountain  was fun, but the ticket are a bit expensive. It was a great experience and also had a good view. The fireworks are good, also the night parade. the only part that was bad was everything was too expensive even the shops. Recommend you to go and only buy one or too things because it will make you have a big budget. It was great fun overall and had a great time. Really recommend you to visit there. Sadly, our favourite Golden Mickey show closed about half year to one year ago, and has become Storybook theatre. Still amazing, but miss the Golden Mickey as Storybook theatre mostly uses computer technology"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364469319,1,2016-4,United States,""I write this as a huge Disney fan. We have been to Orlando Disney at least five time and it is very hard to believe that this place is even run by the same people. First of all, half of it is closed down. While they say on the sign that the main rides are closed for a few days for renovations, i think this is an outright lie. From the looks of it, one of the two main attractions(the mining cars) is covered in scaffolding and looks to be shut down for months, not days. This effectively cuts e park in half. Plus, at least one third if all the restaurants were closed, resulting in mass chaos at the one remixing restaurant This, but the way, was on a Sunday in AprilI don't know who these people are that say you need two days, but that is absurd. We saw every show and road every ride in about 5 hours on a crowed Sunday. Then, we literally ran out of things to do. And for those of you expecting the the magical experience, you better hop on the next plane to Orlando. The place was filled with overflowing trash bins and miserable employees. And when say miserable, think country fair miserable ( rider is over kid, move on ). "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364351146,5,2016-4,Australia,""We brought a 2 day pass, on the second day we went late in the day so the kids would make it to the fireworks without being grumpy tired. So it pretty much rained the whole day the first day, thankfully it was still humid and warm, otherwise would have been a miserable day. But we just slapped on our ponchos and off we went with the rest of the souls there in the rain. Sooo glad it rained!!!! It kept the crowds away and we pretty much walked onto every ride without having to queue and from the looks of some of the queuing areas they can get really really long! We did everything the first day apart from Micky's Comic Book journey and the fireworks. We were so surprised but all of the rides kept running even in the rain. The parades were cancelled however. Our kids really enjoyed the Space Mountain, Mystic Manor, Jungle River Cruise and the 3D PhilharMagic show. My husband got  picked on  during the interactive Stitch Encounter show which the kids thought was great. Be prepared for the expense of food and beverages. WoW expensive. ( eg Micky shaped ice creams on a stick $7 AUD each, still trying to get over it). Ride attendants could use some enthusiasm and perhaps crack a smile every now and again but perhaps this is cultural thing. They are also really strict with their height restrictions for rides to the extent of pushing my 9 year olds hair apart to measure directly on his head. The fireworks don't start until 8:30 pm but they start shutting down rides and areas of the park at 7:30pm so make sure you get your last rides done before then. The fireworks are worth staying for. There is something magical about watching fireworks set to Disney tunes being blasted over a fantasy castle that are truely amazing. In summary the park is small compared to Disney Aneheim, can't even compare, you don't need a 2 day ticket to get everything done, don't be put off by the rain as it does have its advantages!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"364061715,4,2016-4,United Kingdom,""Really enjoyed our day here. It is a small Disneyland but that has the advantage in that you can do this in a day if you are only In HK for a short visit as we were. We only had to queue for a short while on some of the rides our longest wait was for the cable car Its a bit hilly so be prepared and wear suitable shoes... high heels are not a good idea !! We ate lunch there and while it was not gourmet food it was ok for fast food and the staff are well organised so your not waiting too long to get served.. The parade at the end of the day was really lovely and worth staying to watch .. our granddaughter was so excited to see all of the characters and dancing etc., It was easy to get to on the subway Disney Train and not expensive. Worth spending the whole day there, the prices of food snacks drinks is slighty more expensive than outside of the theme park but not too bad ..but if your on a budget take plenty of drinks and snacks with you."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"364041310,5,2016-3,Australia,""For the financees 30th birthday she decided she wanted to be 10 again so it was off to Disneyland we go! I love a good theme park but had never visted a Disney brand land before and was reserving judgement as I wasnt sure how well it would hold up for a childless couple. I was therefore very happy when it turned out to be a great fun day for us both and we were never short of things do. A few of the activities were  a bit young  but you could pick those as being pitched to the correct target audience and we did them anyway. The weather just held we were pretty lucky with relatively short lines most of the day. Make sure you get out there early and avoid holidays if you can. Even with our short queues we still didnt get to see and do all we wanted so you'd have to be pretty selective if you were waiting 30 40 minutes instead of 15 20 like wer were.The place is immacualte. There is nothing around to break the illusion that you are in Disneyland. Everything has been planned and executed to a really high degree and though you know it is a fantasy world, it looks and feels  real . Every corner of the park is manicured and maintained to rediculously high standard. Even the scuff marks, chipped paint and cobwebs you usually see while waiting in line desperate for something to look at are conspicuously absent. They must have an army of workers cleaning and repairing the place every night.One of the big rollar coasters was closed, but other than that we got to enjoy most of the main attractions. The stage shows where multi lingual, if anything favouring English for the most part, but providing the missing subtitles in Cantonese and Mandarin or English where required. It might be small in area, but they pack a lot in to the modest footprint. We prebought food vouchers for lunch, dinner and a snack, which while still expensive as you'd expect, saved us quite a bit. BYO food and drink if you are looking to save money, it is all really pricey. (The popcorn is pretty awesome though!) The two parades (day and night) are definitely worth a watch, as is hanging around for the fireworks just before the park closes. All in all it was a great day out, and the girl cant wait to go to the one in Shanghai that opens soon too.One last hint: The longest line of the day (seriously tried my patience at 90 minutes) was the one she most wanted to join... photos with Mickey & Minnie. It takes AGES and only happens twice a day. There are very limited spots and they close the line as soon as it is full. Check the schedule and send someone very early or like us it will chew up a lot of your time. The only thing worse that that wait would have been the tears if she missed out ";") A very happy 30th birthday girl indeed, she would give it 6 stars."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;
"364030437,4,2016-4,Malaysia,""I can't really fault the Disneyland experience but the website could be a lot more informative. Fastpass is available for 2 attractions   Space Mountain and Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Autopia is simply not worth the 60 minute wait. Water fountains are available throughout the park which is appreciated because the food and drinks are outrageously priced. We decided to exit the park, take a 20 minute MTR ride to Tung Chung MTR station (2 stops away) and eat at the Citigate Mall next to the Tung Chung MTR station and save ourselves a tonne of money, only to spend it at the Disneyland gift shop! An earlier review said that tickets at the park at cheaper. I cannot see how he she arrived at that conclusion. Not only are the tickets at the park counters priced the same, you have to queue up for them. If you had purchased them online, you can have your tickets printed at a separate counter and beat the queue. It's 2016 and I still see 90% of the visitors purchasing tickets at the counter!!! The shows and parades were fantastic and worth your time   Mickey and the Wondrous Book, Festival of the Lion King, and Mickey 3D Theatre. We bought discounted tickets at klook and they are even cheaper than Disneyland's own 10 year anniversary 2 day ticket promotion."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"364002267,4,2016-3,United States,""This it the third time I have been to this Disneyland. I am a self admitted Disneyophile. In the past 2 visits, I have been very pleased with the quality for the price. Yes, this was a smaller park, but the price reflected that. It didn't have a lot of people in it and this was a plus. You could ride on or go directly into any show or attraction, you wanted. The price for food and souvenirs was reasonable. That is all in the past. They have built new lands and new attractions in the last 10 years, not surprising and very welcome. However the price has risen also. It is not what you pay in the US yet, but the number of lands and attractions is not equal yet. What is surprising to me is the hugh increase in the cost of everything overall. No longer can I bring back a shirt or eat in the park. Want a ballon, it will cost you over $20 US. Want a bag to show that you bought the few things you could afford? It too will cost you. The only way I will go back to this Disneyland is if the senior price is still present when I turn 65 in 10 years."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"363903392,5,2016-4,Singapore,""Its an awesome experience. The park is divided by different themes and each theme has restaurants, souvenir shops and different characters for you to take picture with as well as rides or things to do. My 6 year old daughter enjoyed the Mickey's philharmagic in Fantasyland very much. It's a 3D show which was too surreal for her. Boys will definitely love adventureland...

Those parks are just overrated with too many people and little rides.For the rides you need to wait for long time and even for kids is not so much to see.Prices in the park are as usual overpriced as well.

Like small world u notice that the toys are new and cant notice some of the joints. Its a bet of small park so one whole day is good but avoid weekends and holidays it gets really busy. What i didn't like about it were two things. Quality of food was ok, i remember in orlando and paris food was so good but in this park food was average, except for deserts they were very good. Maybe thats to keep cost down but would consider having 1 or 2 resturant with higher quality food (could be burger and pasta better than what they got right now). The biggest thing that upseted me was taking picture with characters. We walked in to the park and my 1 year old saw Mickey and Donald and ran to them. But the people handling the line said they are done cause they got to get ready for the parried. It was only 12 and parried is at 3 pm. They said come back after 3:30!!! Like kids can work with appointments. How can u say no to a kid. What was more upsetting we went to a store close by came out and saw some new people in the line!!! Its like choosing, was going to make an issue on the spot but my girl wanted to play so didn't want to make her day worse.

The first thing you that strikes you is it's just like the one in Anaheim, yet at the same time completely different. It's a weird and wonderful feeling at the same time. Clean, inexpensive and wonderful. It's about half as large (if even that much) and not a lot of ride for older teens or adults, but it's still got that Disney magic that transports you back in time to when you were a kid.

A short walk to the MTR and a transfer to another MTR line lead my wife and myself to the Disney MTR which is Disney related. Upon arrival, we were allowed to bypass the line to the automated ticket dispenser due to my HANDY device.Upon entering the Magic Kingdom, I was greeted with wonderment and awe. It was simply amazing! We ventured to the rides and either one had a to wait 40 minutes for a ride that lasted only 5 minutes, but it was completely safe for the kids. The train ride only went for half way, so if you wish to come back to where you started from, you would need to board again.Food varied at the various restaurants due to themes of the area. BBQ fried squid and shredded was what intrigued my wife and we also had cotton candy at the small kiosks. A fruit flavored snow cone and a chili hot dog was a snack, and the kiosk provided plastic disposable gloves for us to eat the chili dog with.Overall it wa a magical moment for the both of us. One has to wait a bit for the rides, so one should arrive early, like when it opens to beat the line ups. Booking online helps, and if one is a hotel guest, a HANDY mobile device may be included in the room.

"362952191,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,""Not really a Disney fan and visited for my 9 year old daughter but ended up having a superb day and thoroughly enjoying it.It is easy to be cynical about Disney and yes there are lots of opportunities to buy things, but the overall impression is of a genuine *fun* park with very high standards and attention to detail.The park is just the right size for a single day trip (you don't need two) and you can get around all the good rides at least once in this time. Loved it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"362944693,5,2016-4,India,""My 4th visit to Disney, first to Hong Kong Disneyland and yet we all enjoyed with our 3yrs old son, who simply didn't stop talking, he just had too much to process. Fantasy land was the best for him as we took the Disney express around and then to meet Mickey and Money in person was simply too exciting for him. The   'Its a small world after all' ride and the shows 'PhilarMagic'  3d show, new stage show 'Story book' were the best here, also the pachyderm ride and Winnie the pooh ride is good for young children. The next best was Adventure land with the jungle river cruise and the great show 'Festival of the Lion King' should not be missed at all. Avoid the Tomorrow land ride space mountain indoor roller coaster with young kids and if u R not in for sudden jerks and high speed. Toystoryland has good rides for little children. Mystic point was a good ride, Mystic Manor which seems like the new HauntedMansion. Disney Paint the night parade is a great too at 7:30pm at Mainstreet. Overall too much fun, not enough energy with one very exhausted family. BTW the vegetarian options on Mainstreet are very limited but good soup and pasta. Better than in Europe or the US or Tokyo, though these are bigger parks with lot many attractions. Hong Kong Disneyland land is the best covered with the day pass. It was rather warm too with 27 degrees C in the open but was pleasant in the evening."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"362930387,4,2016-4,United States,""The rides seem shorter than in the US Disneylands and the train is definitely slower, but otherwise it's what you would expect from Disney.

362930064,5,2016-4,Australia,SO my kids are 19 and 15 and have never done any disneylands but gee did they have a great time at this place. I would highly recommend but get there early to avoid waiting in line for rides and I would certainly recommend going to the car ride first   we waited an hour.

"362519417,2,2015-8,South Africa,""We love theme parks and have visited several theme parks around the world. Unfortunately this is the worst we've been so far. This was our second visit to Disneyland in Hong Kong. The park was overcrowded with long queus. Due to the guests from mainland China there was a lot of queue jumping which resulted in a lot of fighting and pushing. The staff of the park did nothing to control these people. We stayed for four days but after day two my children did not want to go to the park anymore due to these rude, unbehaved guests from the mainland. Toilets are disgusting with human feces on the floors   again due to these uncivilized guests. The staff are rude and not all of them can speak English. They shout and scream at everyone. It was hot and all queues are in the sun. So be prepared to stand for hours in the sun in a queue with people pushing and breathing on you. I cannot recommend this park to anyone with small children. During the parades adults are pushing you. On more than one occasion I almost dropped my child due this. I visited this park about seven years ago and it was totally different. It definitely worsened over the years. If you are looking for a fun filled family vacation at a theme park, please AVOID this one at all cost. Rather go to the more civilized Disneyland in Tokyo."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"362491800,5,2016-3,United Kingdom,""Although much smaller than the other Disney sites we have visited ( Paris, California and Florida) this Disneyland was well worth the visit.

"362464342,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,""Somehow Disney just know how to run a theme park. They don't charge for fastpass usage. They have great queues. Friendly staff. Well maintained equipment. The only thing is the 'captive pricing' for their food   but on the flip side even that was of decent quality. Well worth going, and the  Disneytrain  from Sunny Bay was pretty cool too.The evening parade and fireworks were the best I've ever seen too! :)"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"362462175,4,2016-4,Ireland,""Firstly, the best way to get here is definitely the MTR rail network. It drops you just one stop away at Sunny Beach and you get the Disney train to the entrance from there. I was fortunate enough to check Disney H K online the night before our visit and I saved a good bit of money by buying the visitors special offer price of two adults and one child for 1087 H K Dollars. Entry price at door is $538 adult and $385 children. Do the maths cos its a  no brainer .! Try and avoid weekends cos queueing is horrendous. We went on Monday and we still had to wait between 40 mins and 1 hour for the various rides. Take in the live shows and arrange the rides between the show times. We saw  The Lion King  and the  Mickey Mouse story book  and both were worth seeing. The parade is also a lovely spectacle so my advice is to arrive early, get the programme of events and the site map and just sit down and plan your day. It will be worth the effort. Its a good day out and we enjoyed it."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"362424132,5,2016-4,China,""We got the two day pass and have 2 small children (age 2 1 2 and 3 months). There were plenty of things to do and we really could have done 3 days at the park. As a nursing mom of an infant I found it really nice. They have a baby care center with private nursing rooms. I loved it because my husband could take my 2 year old on a couple of rides and come back when I was done feeding our baby. There were several rides that I had the infant in our ergo carrier and rode as well. The park is clean, and the staff very friendly as you would expect from any Disney park. We thought the live show performances were pretty good, but the actors and actresses could use some work on their English pronunciation and enunciation as a lot of it was hard to understand even though they were speaking singing in English. It is worth it to stay for the night parade and firework show! "",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also we were lined up for the Autopia but they closed the thing due to weather reports about thunder clouds.. safety first but hello we can survive a few drops of rain.. The Space Mountain however was amazing, did ride it 2 times. The shows were also amazing, especially Festival of The Lion King was incredibly good!! The Mickey and the Wondrous Book show however was partly in Chinese, so make sure to sit on the right side or middle so you can see right monitor where they text it (left side monitor is Chinese only). Flights of Fantasy Parade was great! Just position yourself early to have the beast view. We did Main Street, but I recommend doing the left side of circle looking towards the castle, as the parade stops for quite some time there and perform dances for you to enjoy. Sadly they cancelled the Disney Paint The Night parade..... I wish they would give me a new ticket to watch this.. but they were scared of rain... however it did not rain so much after all..... that sucked.. anyways the fireworks was the best I've ever seen, mainly due to its timing and quality, the brightest and clearest and most colorful fireworks I've ever seen... amazing!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Toy Story Land and the Grizzly Gulch presented a few rides that are good for bigger kids   aka us (ha!). Less people in line but now I know that it's best to get the FAST PASS for the more popular rides like WInnie the Pooh and the 4D shows. Best to visit on a non peak day   weekday, perhaps, if you can. Also on cooler months so the wait in line will not be so horrendous. Everybody is anticipating the biggest Disney Park though, so HK is pulling all stops to make the park more attractive like the afternoon parade in addition to the one at night."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The production for the play is awesome. My family also appreciated much the storyland ride.The lights parade at night and the new fireworks display with the projected story is a must see.And as an add on treat, we always make it a point to buy the turkey leg and grilled squid at the shop near the toy story area."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Kind of like the California park's Haunted Mansion, with lots of animatronics, holographic projections and Disney characters that we have never experienced before.It was raining most of the Thursday we chose to visit. Still lots of people, but VERY SHORT lines into all attractions.Our trip to Hong Kong was for eleven days. We ate VERY WELL, but truth be told, we had some of the best Cantonese food during our entire trip in the park at the Plaza Inn off Main Street!Even if you don't get to Disneyland HK, you should take the special one stop metro that services it, as the trains have Mickey Mouse shaped windows and subway straps, and blue velvet couch style seating, with brass sculptured Disney characters in the cars.A must for all kids, young and old!"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

I wouldn't want to go in the summer with rain, heat and high humidity. In each of the four or 5 sectors, there is one big ticket ride. The lines as always in Disney are long and for some of the rides, we felt that a 40 minute wait was not worth it   Winnie the Pooh ride and the Autopia ride for example. If you have a toddler, I'd avoid any rides with long lines. You can get fast track tickets which are a better option but go early and plan your rides ahead for this option to work for you. Food options are very limited with a few corn cob, hot dog, pop corn and candy floss stalls and over crowded restaurants selling mediocre Chinese and western food. Take your own. We purchased a 2 day ticket but were fed up with the heat and the crowds after a day. If you are selective about your rides, there is no need to purchase a 2 day ticket.

Beware of the Space Mountain rollercoaster. There were plenty of tears from kids leaving the ride and perhaps a few adults. If all the other rides average 3 in scariness, Space Mountain is a 20.

"360926957,4,2016-2,Australia,""So, before I went to this Disney I was racking my brain to decide if I wanted to purchase a two day pass or a single day pass   I knew it was the smallest Disneyland but there were conflicting reviews about it so I decided to go the two day. I got everything done in the first. Sure, I was really lucky with some of the wait times but I ended up going on pretty much every single ride, saw every single show and went into every single gift shop. I would imagine for a normal family, there would be some attractions you would be interested in and some you would not be. Also I should mention I went right in the middle of Chinese New Year so the park was packed with locals meaning i'd expect wait times to be even better from what I had experienced. This park also doesn't have as much of a variety of pop up character appearances or merchandise options so my focus of the second day ended up just being me repeating shows rides to get my money's worth. Don't get me wrong, I am a Disney fanatic but once you calculate the passes, the accommodation for the extra night you're staying in HK, if you eat the overpriced park food and I imagine the emotional investment in dealing with a tired child, i'd save it for one day, choose the highlights you really WANT to see and then work your way from there   you'll have enough time."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"360814127,4,2016-3,China,""This is one of the small Disneylands but very good to spend a day or two in, especially with children that are not yet teenagers.We visited Hong Kong Disneyland on a Tuesday in March and that was probably a very good decision. It wasn't too hot and the queues   waiting lines were not so long.Everything was very well taken care of and clean and the staff   sorry, cast   was very friendly and helpful. My daughter (6 years) loved hunting for stickers.I personally love roller coasters and fast rides but for that there was only RC Racer in Toyland and   of course   Space Mountain. But there are plenty of rides for the not so big children.We were there on a not so busy day and I still think the ratio waiting time to duration of ride was not very good. I would seriously considered buying a  fast track  ticket next time.Being used to Chinese habits (we live in Beijing) I was a bit anxious about queue jumping and general pushing and shoving but I was pleasantly surprised.We had dinner in the  Explorer's Club  Restaurant and that unfortunately was disappointing   it tasted like canteen food in a very big company.All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and I will probably be back with my daughter."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"360803488,4,2016-1,Singapore,""Disneyland as mentioned, it's a place for young and old. To complete the themepark, I would recommend if you allocated 2 days. I went for a day and only manage to complete 70% with 2 photos sessions. Some few tips & helps on purchasing tickets and entering the theme park. 1 Choose a date where it's non peak season We bought the ticket during the season where not all seasonal ticket holders are allow to entered the theme park. You will be able to check the block out dates at the bottom of the page   Park & Schedule   Park Calendar. 2 Collection of tickets.If you purchased the via online or agent. Head toward the park entrance toward the right and you will be able to find the self machine ticket collection. Just scan the QR code on the printed email and the machine will dispense the tickets.  3 Priority entrance for Disneyland Hotels If you are staying at any Disneyland Hotels, there is a priority queue located at the right side (at the edge of the theme park). You will be able to skip the queue and enter the theme park.  4 Fast Pass for Space Mountain (Roller Coaster) & The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.When you arrive at the theme park, do remember to collect the pass from these 2 rides. With the fast pass you will be allocated to a time slot and skip the queue. Do remember there are limited fast pass per day  5 Disney PhotoPass Plus (Digital download at HK$398)Instead of purchasing individual photos when you take a photo with your favourite Disney Character. You will be able to receive ALL softcopy photos you took around the park. You will be able to customize different borders for up to 14 days upon purchase. Just search for  Disney PhotoPass  in the website to find out more. 6 Firework, Day Parade & Night Parade For Firework, the best place to see it is in front of the sleeping beauty castle. For Day Parade & Night Parade, the best view somewhere near the right (facing the castle) where you will be able to see any incoming and outgoing shows. Reach there early to avoid disappointment. Hope that help."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"360784577,5,2016-3,Thailand,""Hong Kong Disneyland is a must visit for young and old alike. Even if it is on a smaller scale to others it has enough to cater for everyone. The smaller size makes ease of access to rides and attractions without hours and hours of queuing.The food within the park is reasonable and cheap for a fun park.Must sees are Story Book , The Lion King shows and for the littlies Small Land. The rollercoasters will keep the older children and young at heart amused.Make sure to see the Parades night and day and the fireworks.Have a Good 2 Days planned for this ."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"360674864,5,2016-4,Australia,""So i was going to subject this, Loved it but expensive, but then on the train ride back to our hotel it got me thinking, how many times in life do you get to go to Disneyland? Look, im very far from comfortable and i work hard for what money i do get, but today money wasnt a factor... instead of writing 1 massive post and trying to browse what you need, ill list it out. This is from a 30 year and 26 year old perspective...Getting there: take the train wherever you come from, its quick easy and quite cheap, THATS IT!Tickets: we booked online and arrived at 930 and barely anyone was there, we still had to line up, so didnt really matter what you do...Food and drink: if moneys not a matter, buy it there, if you're on a budget, try n get some cheaper sandwiches or whatever you like and few bottles of water before you go, food really is quite expensive and to put it this way, a coffe cost me 48Hkd and a hot dog was 67Hkd...hkg in general is actually quite expensive to think about it..Rides: the ones we went on, TomorrowLand, space mountain was 1 of the best rides i ever been on hahahah seriously i even went back for a second go, Orbitron was terrible for us but a good kids ride and the same for autotopia, FantasyLand, got our pictures taken with mickey and minney yaaaay, Its a small world was quite good to rest the feet and see something different...ToyStoryLand: defiantly line to go on the rc racer, try and get upfront, only goes for 40 seconds but worth it... everything else is good for the kids and just ask me if you want to know more as i theres too much...Souvenirs: everything you could ask for, once again not cheap but when in disneyland do as the tourists do, buy something! You can get some bargains, theres a place in FantasyLand just before ToyStoryLand you can get some things 40 to 70% off...Overall experience: i effin loved this place, probably because i finally got to come to a disneyland after 20 odd years of wanting to go... if you want to watch the fireworks, get to park around 1200 or 1300 as the rides seem to die down after 1600 amd does take some time to get around the park if you want to see it all...take plenty of water, AND MAKE SURE YOU WEAR RUNNERS OR SOMETHING VERY COMFORTABLE!!!

"360568124,3,2016-4,Thailand,""After an easy but very busy train ride, you will be greeted with a very long walk to the entrance, we took the train around the park first to get a look at where to explore, all you see is trees, the main ride was down for maintenance, mystic manor is fantastic ride, the rest are boring, it's all but impossible to get a photo with a character, food and souvenirs are very expensive, movie world in Brisbane Australia is so much better."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
360548978,5,2016-3,India,Best way from Tsim Sha Tsui take MTR change at Lai King & then Sunny Bay or from Tsim Sha Tsui East station also take west rail line to change at Nam cheung and then Sunny Bay. Both are very easy and later is faster. Cost about HKD 18 by Octopus. Entry tickets from online agents like Klook etc to save money with print out. Start from one side like Adventure land. Before going next land come back little bit and have lunch etc at Tahiti etc. Can prebook meal coupon from online agent to save money. However do remember to convert printout to meal coupon at entry gate before you enter. Later you cannot. 3 meal option ticket is not good. As snacks is worthless only sweet popcorn or Ice cream. Dinner you may not like inside. 3 adults meal can cover family of 4 with 1 2 kids. Go early and see all rides. All are wonderful. Enter by 11 am then exit can happen by 7 pm. Return by similar route and take dinner outside to save money. No known branded restaurant inside disneyland.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"360407585,4,2016-3,United Kingdom,""As a cynic, I was sceptical about getting excited about meeting Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Nevertheless, I figured that Disneyland would probably be a hit with the kids (3 and 7 yrs). It was busy but the queues were reasonable. Longest time spent queuing for an attraction was 45 mins (lion king performance). The lion king and Mickey Mouse shows were amazing. My little one totally believed the cast were real and was so excited. The singing, the stage, the interactive play were all entertaining. My cynicism about Disneyland melted away immediately and totally got into all the hype. The atmosphere was very friendly. Only downside was the food. Lots of choice but pricey and not the best quality. Must see the day and night parade. Both as good as each other. Didn't disappoint. The fireworks at the end of the night finished off an enjoyable visit nicely. Best place to see the fireworks is in front of the Disney castle. Would recommend...

Dissapointed that some of the rides were closed during school holidays forcing the throngs into bigger queues on all other rides. Park staff (cast members) all happy to help and very good with the kids from baby thru pre teen.

The place is also friendly to wheel chair and senior citizens and the washrooms, drinking water is well spaced and plenty of places to rest.

We were very happily surprised with HK Disney because even though we were there during Easter weekend and there were loads of people, the experience was very pleasant. Most rides were 5 20 minutes wait only. The food was much better than at Disneyland in California, maybe because Americans are used to junk food? Anyway, HK Disney had a lot more choices of home style foods such as Chinese food, noodle soups, Italian pastas, steaks, and lots of cute shaped food such as Mickey shaped white rice and little pig shaped dumplings. The Toy Story land area was beautifully decorated. It's so easy to get to HK Disney with the Disney dedicated metro line.

In fact, my husband, who is not a very  rides  person, ranked this as the best place we visited at HK. The 3D show is the best 3D I have seen in my life. In fact its actually a 4D where through appropriate aroma and other things you actually feel that you are part of the drama. I actually tried to catch the cake that came flying over to me!

Went on a Wednesday and there was not much of a queue for tickets at the door. There are cast members watching the queue and directing guests and weeding out queue jumpers! The park has been extended since the original 2006 plan but still you can easily do the whole park in one day by yourself. The park was not busy at all, and I hardly had to queue for anything, except shows and RC racer, which is very popular but has no fast pass. It is the best thrill ride in the park though, so an absolute must! Worth the queue! Space mountain and parachute drop have single rider queues that are very quick. Characters are plentiful, and I got to meet Beymax, which I was so excited about!The other highlights for me were the shows: Mickey's wondrous story book and the Lion King: outstanding performances!!! Definitely make sure you get to see them! For me both shows were not full at all, but make sure you arrive at least ten minutes before show time because they close the doors before the actual show time.Lastly, the parades were cancelled due to bad weather, but HK Disneyland did not disappoint its guests and put out the 'Rainy day parade' with the princesses, Toy story characters and the main gang  with their special raincoats! Jolly good show!The Disney Magic is well and truly alive in Hong Kong! It's not super friendly bordering on cheese Florida nor does it have all the thrills of Paris, but it presents you with entertainment and attractions that the whole family can enjoy, and just as Walt Disney intended, everyone of all ages has a smile on their face : )"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;

And we didn't manage to know the time of Disney mascot available for photo taking session, The moment we arrive at the place, it is closed. A big regret didn't manage to take photo with the mascot. All the other rides is really fun. It's a big place, so, plan your time wisely so that you will have time to try all the rides.

359113313,5,2016-3,Australia,This was a dream come true for our family. We totally loved every second. Lots of photo opportunities with characters. Rides were so much fun. The atmosphere was exactly what we expected for a Disney Park. The waiting lines can be quite long and other patrons can be quite pushy so keep that in mind and take lots if little breaks during the day. We had a 2 day pass and still didn't get to see everything. Highly recommend!!! Oh and make sure you see the Light the Night Parade at 7.30pm in Main St USA and the Fireworks show at 8.45pm over the Castle. Oh and if its your birthday make sure to go to City Hall in Main Street USA and get your birthday badge. If you decide to stay at a Disney Hotel and have a young daughter look into the Bibbity Bobbity Boutique princess experience that runs out of the Disneyland Hotel. You need to book though. If you stay at the Disneyland Hollywood Hotel like we did make sure to have a brekky or dinner at Chef Mickeys. LOVED IT!! ,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"359004444,5,2016-3,New Zealand,""Can't tell more about Hongkong Disneyland. Excellent place for all ages from 8 to 80 :)You can spend all day in this theme park and watch fire work around 9pm. A lot of activities, games, park, etc are waiting you explore them. Make sure you have enough time to visit this park (at least 4 5 hours). Do not miss when you are in Hongkong"",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
358913289,5,2016-3,Australia,Loved it.  Our two small children had a great time.  The food though was not good and was very over priced.  The night parade was the most awesome thing we have ever seen.,Disneyland_HongKong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"358822998,5,2015-10,New Zealand,""We took our grandchildren to Hong Kong Disneyland and just loved it. You can use their pushchairs so that when the children become tired they can rest whilst you continue to walk around looking at all the colours, characters and fun of Disneyland. The restaurants are lovely and we preferred them rather than the street food. It was better selection in the restaurants."",Disneyland_HongKong";;;;;;;;;;;;;
